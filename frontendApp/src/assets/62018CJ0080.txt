<p class="normal">The preamble to Ley 15/2012 de medidas fiscales para la sostenibilidad energética (Law 15/2012 on fiscal measures for sustainable energy), of 27 December 2012 (BOE No 312, of 28 December 2012, p. 88081, ‘the Energy Tax Law’), states:</p>
<p class="normal">‘The objective of [this Law] is to adapt our tax system to more efficient and environmentally friendly use and sustainable development …</p>
<p class="normal">…</p>
<p class="normal">The basic foundation of this Law is Article 45 of the Constitution …</p>
<p class="normal">Thus, one of the axes of this tax reform is to internalise the environmental costs resulting from electricity production …</p>
<p class="normal">The Law must serve as a stimulus to improve our levels of energy efficiency while at the same time ensuring better management of natural resources and continuing to enhance the new model of sustainable development, both from an economic and social point of view, as well as from an environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="normal">…</p>
<p class="normal">To this end, this Law regulates three new taxes: … the tax on the production of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste resulting from the generation of nuclear power, and the tax on the storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in centralised facilities …</p>
<p class="normal">…</p>
<p class="normal">The production of electricity using nuclear energy implies the acceptance by society of a number of burdens and obligations, due to the particular characteristics of this type of energy, whose economic impact is difficult to determine. Society must assume a wide range of responsibilities resulting from this production, such as the management of the radioactive waste generated and the possible use of materials for non-peaceful purposes.</p>
<p class="normal">… The assessment of the total cost of decommissioning nuclear power plants and the final management of radioactive waste still present significant uncertainties that will ultimately affect society after the cessation of operation of nuclear power plants, in particular with regard to the final management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.</p>
<p class="normal">Thus, given the long life span of some radioactive waste, which extends over generations, it is essential to establish, after its final management, the necessary measures to prevent an external agent from causing its release into the environment or any other adverse effects, which will require long-term institutional monitoring, that will be the responsibility of the State.</p>
<p class="normal">Another distinctive feature of the nuclear power industry is the use and production of materials that must be strictly controlled in order to prevent them from being used for non-peaceful purposes or any other type of malicious act affecting them, which requires Spain … to assume the attendant responsibilities and, therefore, provide resources to deal with this.</p>
<p class="normal">Thus, the State must provide the necessary resources to keep existing nuclear emergency plans operational.</p>
<p class="normal">In the light of the above, it is appropriate to establish a levy on the production of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in nuclear installations and on their storage in centralised facilities in order to offset the costs which society has to bear as a result of that production.’</p>

That court states that, in order to adjudicate on whether that order is lawful, it must determine whether the obligations provided for by that Law are contrary to EU law, and more specifically to the rules and principles governing the electricity market. It considers that the taxes on nuclear energy form part of energy taxation, although they do not tax the production of energy itself, but rather the fuel used in its production and the waste generated. Since the levies from those taxes relate to the production and storage of that fuel and the derived nuclear waste, it considers that they relate to the production of electricity itself and, therefore, affect electricity-generating undertakings.</p>

<p class="normal">In the first place, since the first, fourth and fifth questions concern the interpretation of the polluter-pays principle, as referred to in Article 191(2) TFEU, it should be observed that Article 191(2) TFEU provides that EU policy on the environment is to aim at a high level of protection and is to be based, inter alia, on the polluter pays principle. That provision thus does no more than define the general environmental objectives of the European Union, since Article 192 TFEU confers on the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, responsibility for deciding what action is to be taken in order to attain those objectives (judgment of 4 March 2015, Fipa Group and Others, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A140&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑534/13</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A140&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=null" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2015:140</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A140&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=null&amp;anchor=#point39" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">39</a> and the case-law cited).</p>
