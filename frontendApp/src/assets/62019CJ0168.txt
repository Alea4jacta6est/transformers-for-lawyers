After transferring their residence to Portugal, they requested the INPS, in 2015, that they receive, pursuant to Article 18 and Article 19(2) of the Italian-Portuguese Convention, the gross amount of their monthly retirement pension, without deduction of tax at source by the Italian Republic. The INPS rejected those requests, taking the view that, pursuant to Article 19 of the Italian-Portuguese Convention, unlike Italian pensioners in the private sector, retired employees in the Italian public sector must be taxed in Italy, and only in that Contracting State. HB and IC each brought actions against those decisions before the referring court, the Corte dei conti — Sezione Giurisdizionale per la Regione Puglia (Court of Auditors — Judicial Chamber for the Region of Puglia, Italy).</p>

To that end, the Court should, where necessary, reformulate the questions referred to it (judgment of 3 March 2020, Gómez del Moral Guasch, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2020%3A138&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑125/18</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2020%3A138" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2020:138</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2020%3A138" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">27</a>).</p>

On the basis of that provision of the TFEU, the referring court appears to indicate to the Court that the transfer of residence took place after the applicants in the main proceedings had ceased all occupational activity.

<p class="coj-normal">It follows from an application to the circumstances of the main proceedings of the principles identified in the case-law of the Court, referred to in paragraphs 16 to 20 of the present judgment, that the difference in treatment which the applicants in the main proceedings claim to have suffered arises from the allocation of the power to impose taxes between the parties to the Italian-Portuguese Convention and from the disparities existing between the respective tax systems of those contracting parties. The choice of various connecting factors, made by those parties for the purpose of allocating powers of taxation between them, such as, in the present case, the State responsible for paying the retirement pension and nationality, must not be regarded, as such, as constituting discrimination prohibited by Articles 18 TFEU and 21 TFEU (see, by analogy, judgment of 19 November 2015, Bukovansky, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A766&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑241/14</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A766" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2015:766</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A766" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">45</a>).</p>
