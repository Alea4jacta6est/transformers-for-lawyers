In that regard, that court held that the purpose of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008 is to ensure absolute transparency in the price of air tickets from the moment the person concerned has decided to commence the booking process and not to encourage the public to obtain the most advantageous means of payment beforehand.</p>

Where an air carrier offers an online check-in service for payment, while offering passengers alternative ways to check-in free of charge, passengers’ online check-in fees cannot be regarded as an unavoidable component of the final price to be paid, within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008, but must be regarded as an optional price supplement, within the meaning of the fourth sentence of that provision, which the consumer may choose to accept or refuse.</p>

Although it may be classified as unavoidable because it is compulsory, the VAT applied to optional supplements relating to domestic flights cannot be regarded as foreseeable, since it is intrinsically linked to the optional supplements which are chosen exclusively by the passenger. The air carrier cannot know at the outset which optional supplements the customer will choose, so that the amount of VAT relating to those supplements cannot be included in the foreseeable final price that must be indicated at the time the offer is published.</p>

Thus, if a tax applies to the air fare, it must be shown separately with that tariff from the first time the final price to be paid is indicated, whereas, if it relates to an optional price supplement, it is only required to be indicated — and can only be indicated — in the final price to be paid once the supplement is indicated.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In the latter case, it should be clarified that, as the Commission points out in its written observations, the amount of tax must be clearly indicated in the price of optional services from the first time that they are shown. The requirement for clarity and transparency with which an air carrier must comply in the communication of optional price supplements, under the fourth sentence of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008, means that the portion represented by VAT in the amount for the supplement must be communicated to the passenger as soon as he or she has opted for an optional service. The communication of that part of the price also meets the objective pursued by Regulation No 1008/2008, according to recital 16 thereof, of ensuring effective comparability of the price of air services, as the consumer must be able to compare price supplements excluding VAT offered by air carriers on the domestic route concerned.</p>

However, it cannot be accepted that a price supplement is avoidable and therefore optional where the option offered to the consumer is subject to a condition imposed by the air carrier, by reserving the free nature of the service in question for the benefit of a restricted class of privileged consumers and by requiring, de facto, the consumers who do not form part of that class to either refuse the service that is free of charge, or not to proceed with their purchase immediately and to undertake steps that may entail costs in order to satisfy the condition required, at the risk, once those steps have been completed, of no longer being able to benefit from the offer or of no longer being able to benefit from the price originally indicated.</p>
