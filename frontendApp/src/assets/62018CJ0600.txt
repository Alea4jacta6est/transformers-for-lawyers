As is clear from Directive 2006/22, infringements of the provisions relating to the use of tachographs are to be classified as the most serious infringements. Consequently, and irrespective of any possible difference of treatment in Hungary between resident and non-resident SMEs, it is not possible to substitute the fine for a warning.

<p class="normal">The requirement that penalties be non-discriminatory undoubtedly relates to the situation in which an infringement of Regulation No 165/2014, of the same degree of gravity, entails different penalties depending on whether or not the road transport enterprise concerned is established in the Member State in whose territory the infringement was committed. That regulation proceeds from the assumption that those enterprises, irrespective of where they are established, are in a comparable situation when they commit an infringement of Regulation No 165/2014 in the territory of the same Member State. Consequently, a Member State must ensure that the system of penalties imposed within its territory, in accordance with Article 41(1) of that regulation, apply without distinction based on the place of establishment of the road transport enterprise which has infringed the regulation.</p>
