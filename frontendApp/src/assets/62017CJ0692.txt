In that regard, it relied on the case-law of the Court relating to the provision of EU law transposed into Portuguese law by Article 9(27)(a) of the VAT Code, namely Article 13B(d)(1) of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (<a href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1977:145:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1977 L 145, p. 1</a>; ‘the Sixth Directive’).

Consequently, the transaction at issue in the main proceedings is a direct extension of PNC’s main activity.</p>

The transaction examined by the Court in that judgment consisted in the purchase by an operator, at his own risk, of defaulted debts at a price below their face value, in respect of which the Court concluded, in paragraph 26 of that judgment, that an operator purchasing such debts does not effect a supply of services for consideration and does not carry out an economic activity falling within the scope of the Sixth Directive when the difference between the face value of those debts and their purchase price reflects the actual economic value of the debts at the time of their assignment. By contrast, the transaction at issue in the main proceedings consists in the assignment, to a third party, for remuneration, of all the rights and obligations deriving from a taxable person’s position in enforcement proceedings for recovery of a debt recognised by a judgment.</p>
