The referring court is, therefore, uncertain whether greater importance should be attributed to a de facto (unregistered) partnership or to the legal effects of that relationship. In that regard, it states that, from a material point of view, there is no fundamental difference between such a de facto (unregistered) partnership and marriage, both being based on an affectionate and economic relationship. By contrast, from a legal point of view, Hungarian law regulated the two types of union differently, in particular as regards division of shared property, responsibility for child support maintenance, use of the home and succession. However, with regard to social welfare benefits, tax and housing benefits for families, there were no substantial differences between spouses and de facto (unregistered) partners.</p>
