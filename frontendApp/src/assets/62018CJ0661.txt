<p class="coj-normal">Concerning those principles, it should be borne in mind, first, regarding the principle of proportionality, that it does not preclude a Member State which has exercised the power to authorise its taxpayers a right of option for a special taxation scheme from adopting legislation which makes the application of that scheme conditional upon non-retroactive, prior approval by the tax authorities, and that the fact that the approval process is not retroactive does not make that process disproportionate. Consequently, national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not allow taxable persons to apply the deduction system based on actual use once the final proportion has been fixed does not go beyond what is necessary for the correct collection of VAT (see, by analogy with the exemption scheme for small enterprises, judgment of 17 May 2018, Vámos, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A321&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑566/16</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A321" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:321</a>, paragraphs <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A321" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">43</a> to <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A321" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">45</a> and the case-law cited).</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Next, concerning the principle of fiscal neutrality, it is true, according to the Court’s case-law, that the Member States may, pursuant to Article 173(2)(c) of the VAT Directive, apply, for a given transaction, a method or allocation key other than the turnover-based method, on condition that, in accordance with the principle of fiscal neutrality, that method guarantees a more precise determination of the deductible proportion of the input VAT than that arising from the application of the turnover-based method. Thus, any Member State which decides to authorise or require the taxable person to deduct VAT on the basis of the use made of all or part of the goods and services must ensure that the method for calculating the deduction entitlement makes it possible to ascertain with the greatest possible precision the portion of VAT relating to transactions in respect of which VAT is deductible. The principle of fiscal neutrality, which forms an integral part of the common system of VAT, requires that the method by which the deduction is calculated objectively reflects the actual share of the expenditure resulting from the acquisition of mixed-use goods and services that may be attributed to transactions in respect of which VAT is deductible (see to that effect judgment of 18 October 2018, Volkswagen Financial Services (UK), <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A845&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑153/17</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A845" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:845</a>, paragraphs <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A845" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">51</a> et 52 and the case-law cited).</p>

<p class="coj-normal">It is apparent from the order for reference and the answers given by the parties to the questions put by the Court that, when it chose to deduct the VAT relating to certain goods and services on the basis of the turnover-based method for the years at issue in the main proceedings, CTT took into consideration the fact that the postal bill-payment services which it provided were tax-exempt according to the 2007 binding tax ruling. However, in the course of 2015, the competent tax authority took the view that the liberalisation of the postal services market, which commenced on 1 January 2013, limited the scope of the exemption to the services provided by the public postal service. Therefore, according to the competent tax authority, CTT incorrectly regarded postal bill-payment services, in respect of the period 2013 to 2015, as VAT-exempt.</p>

It is sufficient to point out in that regard that calling into question the exemption of an input transaction may have the effect that certain goods or services which were regarded as intended for mixed use are, in fact, only used for transactions in respect of which VAT is deductible. It is clear from the wording of Article 173 of the VAT Directive that it only applies to goods and services intended for mixed use.
