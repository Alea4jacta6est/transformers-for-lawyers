<p class="normal">Thus, basing its judgment on Article 5 of Regulation No 883/2004, the Court of Appeal of Colmar found that the German assistance was equivalent to the child-rearing allowance for a disabled child provided for in Article L. 541-1 of the French Social Security Code (‘the French allowance’), with the effect that SJ was entitled to the increase in the pension rate. The appeal court thereby inferred that the rate applicable to SJ’s retirement pension was to be increased by an amount corresponding to eight quarters of career owing to the raising of her disabled child.</p>

It maintains that, by that ruling, the judgment on appeal could, in essence, give rise to reverse discrimination against insured persons who have been subject to the French system only compared with those who have been subject to the benefit systems of other Member States.</p>

<p class="normal">Secondly, as the Commission noted in essence in its written observations, the benefit at issue in the main proceedings seeks to compensate for disadvantages in terms of career that may have been suffered by persons who have raised a severely disabled child, by granting an increase in the contribution periods that is proportionate to the period spent raising the disabled child, which is then reflected in an increase in the pension amount paid to such persons. Accordingly, that benefit, in so far as it is intended to safeguard the means of subsistence of persons who, when they reach a certain age, leave their employment and are no longer required to hold themselves available for work at the employment office, relates to the risk covered by old-age benefits, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(d) of Regulation No 883/2004 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2015, Commission v Slovakia, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A601&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑361/13</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A601&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=null" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2015:601</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A601&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=null&amp;anchor=#point55" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">55</a> and the case-law cited).</p>

<p class="normal">As regards the second of the conditions set out in paragraph 45 of the present judgment, it should be noted that, for the purposes of granting the increase in the pension rate, Article L. 351-4-1 of the French Social Security Code does not require that the French allowance be obtained beforehand, but rather that the conditions justifying such an allowance, laid down by Article L. 541-1 of that code, are met. In particular, in accordance with the latter provision, in order that insured persons raising a disabled child may benefit from such an increase, the child’s permanent incapacity must be at least equal to a specific rate, set by Article R. 541-1 of that code at 80%.</p>
