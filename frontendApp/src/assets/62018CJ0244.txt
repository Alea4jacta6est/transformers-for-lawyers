<p class="coj-normal">‘In order to avoid any doubts, the notion of State resources should thus be clarified as regards State guarantees. The benefit of a State guarantee is that the risk associated with the guarantee is carried by the State. Such risk-carrying by the State should normally be remunerated by an appropriate premium. Where the State forgoes all or part of such a premium, there is both a benefit for the undertaking and a drain on the resources of the State. Thus, even if it turns out that no payments are ever made by the State under a guarantee, there may nevertheless be State aid under Article [107(1) TFEU]. The aid is granted at the moment when the guarantee is given, not when the guarantee is invoked nor when payments are made under the terms of the guarantee. Whether or not a guarantee constitutes State aid, and, if so, what the amount of that State aid may be, must be assessed at the moment when the guarantee is given.’</p>

<p class="coj-normal">A market-oriented price is paid for the guarantee.</p>
<p class="coj-normal">As indicated under point 2.1, risk-carrying should normally be remunerated by an appropriate premium on the guaranteed or counter-guaranteed amount. When the price paid for the guarantee is at least as high as the corresponding guarantee premium benchmark that can be found on the financial markets, the guarantee does not contain aid.</p>
<p class="coj-normal">If no corresponding guarantee premium benchmark can be found on the financial markets, the total financial cost of the guaranteed loan, including the interest rate of the loan and the guarantee premium, has to be compared to the market price of a similar non-guaranteed loan.</p>
<p class="coj-normal">In both cases, in order to determine the corresponding market price, the characteristics of the guarantee and of the underlying loan should be taken into consideration. This includes: the amount and duration of the transaction; the security given by the borrower and other experience affecting the recovery rate evaluation; the probability of default of the borrower due to its financial position, its sector of activity and prospects; as well as other economic conditions. This analysis should notably allow the borrower to be classified by means of a risk rating. This classification may be provided by an internationally recognised rating agency or, where available, by the internal rating used by the bank providing the underlying loan. The Commission points to the link between rating and default rate made by international financial institutions, whose work is also publicly available … To assess whether the premium is in line with the market prices the Member State can carry out a comparison of prices paid by similarly rated undertakings on the market.</p>
<p class="coj-normal">The Commission will therefore not accept that the guarantee premium is set at a single rate deemed to correspond to an overall industry standard.’</p>

<p class="coj-normal">The resulting yearly cash grant equivalents should be discounted to their present value using the reference rate, then added up to obtain the total grant equivalent.</p>

The fact that that information was subsequently authenticated through Larko’s financial statements cannot call that finding into question. Furthermore, according to the case-law of the General Court, events which took place during a given period may also be proved by subsequent documents based on those earlier events.

It thus disregarded the Commission’s obligations relating to a diligent and impartial examination.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">First of all, it is clear from the 2008 loan agreement available to the Commission that repayment of the loans provided for in that agreement was to be completed on 31 March 2012, well before the adoption of the decision at issue on 27 March 2014. The Commission therefore had at its disposal all the information enabling it to conclude that those loans were to be repaid by then. Next, repayment of the loan granted in 2010 was to be completed 45 days after the adoption of the decision at issue. Lastly, on that date, it was possible for the Commission to note that the loan concerned by measure No 6 had already been partially repaid.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Third, the obligation to repay both the lender and the State guaranteeing the entire loan granted leads to the paradoxical result that a company repaying its loan finds itself in a more difficult situation than a company which has had the State guarantee invoked.

<p class="coj-normal">Fourth, Larko notes that, when the decision at issue was adopted, there was no precedent, either in case-law or in the Commission’s practice, for recovering, under a guarantee, the full value of a guaranteed loan when the guarantee has not been called on. The cases to which the Commission refers concern other factual circumstances where the guarantees were called on. By contrast, in a similar case, where the loans were subsequently repaid, the Commission took that fact into account and did not require the amount of the loans to be recovered, but applied an increased reference rate. It should have done the same in the present case.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Sixth, the decision at issue constitutes an unlawful penalty as a result of the misapplication of part (a) of the third paragraph of point 4.1 of the Guarantee Notice, which allows such a step to be taken only if there are exceptional circumstances. Such an assessment must have precise reasoning and cannot be based either on the Commission’s ‘doubts’ relating to Larko’s ability to obtain a loan, such as those expressed in recitals 77 and 104 of the decision at issue, or on the lack of evidence indicating that the guarantee was invoked, as referred to in recitals 78, 95 and 105 of that decision.</p>

In particular, the Commission contends that Larko is not challenging the legal test applied by the General Court, but, in an inadmissible manner, is challenging the establishment of the facts to which the General Court applied that test. The General Court found that there were exceptional circumstances because, when measures Nos 2, 4 and 6 were granted, Larko was in an ‘extremely delicate situation’ which made it ‘impossible for Larko to repay the entirety of the loan from its own resources’.</p>
