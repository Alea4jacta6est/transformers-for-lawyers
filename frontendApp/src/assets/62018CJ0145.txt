Situation of art photographs.’, published in the <span class="italic">Bulletin officiel des impôts</span> No 115 of 2 July 2003, as applicable at the time of the material facts of the case in the main proceedings (‘the Ministerial Directive of 25 June 2003’), was intended to provide clarification regarding the conditions for applying the reduced rate of VAT laid down in Article 278(f) of the CGI in respect of art photographs. The Ministerial Directive provided:</p>
<p class="normal">‘…</p>
<p class="normal">I. Criteria for art photographs:</p>
<p class="normal">1.   Only photographs demonstrating clear creative intent on the part of their creator may be regarded as works of art eligible for the reduced rate of VAT.</p>
<p class="normal">That is the case where, through subject choice, setting, features of the shot or any other distinctive characteristic of the photographer’s work, such as framing quality, composition, exposure, lighting, contrast, colours and relief, play of light and volume, lens and film selection or the specific conditions in which the negative is processed, he produces a work which goes beyond the simple mechanical fixation of the memory of an event, trip or people and which is thus of interest to any audience.</p>
<p class="normal">II. Conditions for application</p>
<p class="normal">1.   In the light of the above, identity photographs, school photographs and group photographs are not eligible for the reduced rate.</p>
<p class="normal">2.   Photographs where interest depends primarily on the status of the individual or the nature of the object shown are not, in general, regarded as art photographs. That is the case, for example, with photographs depicting family or religious events (weddings, communions etc.).</p>
<p class="normal">3.   That being said, for photographs of any kind other than those mentioned in II-1, the creative intent of the creator as evidenced by the criteria already set out and the interest to any audience may be reinforced by the following indicators:</p>
<p class="normal">(a) The photographer proves that his works have been exhibited in cultural institutions (regional, national or international), museological institutions (museums, temporary or permanent exhibitions) or commercial institutions (trade fairs, shows, galleries etc.) or that they have been presented in specialist publications.</p>
<p class="normal">…</p>

<p class="normal">The French Government submits that only ‘art photographs’ may be eligible for the reduced rate of VAT, a concept which, in that government’s view, is restricted to photographs demonstrating clear creative intent on the part of their creator and being of interest to any audience. That interpretation stems from the use of the word ‘artist’ in point 7 of Part A of Annex IX to the VAT Directive, the need to interpret the option of applying a reduced rate of VAT strictly, as an exception to the principle of applying the standard rate of VAT, and the objective of promoting artistic production by applying a reduced rate of VAT.</p>

Furthermore, they emphasise the detailed and objective nature of the conditions that photographs must satisfy under that point 7 in order to be regarded as works of art, whereas the artistic merit of a photograph constitutes, in their view, a subjective and indeterminate criterion whose assessment entails a judgement on the merits of a work. They submit that it is in order to avoid such a subjective assessment that the EU legislature laid down, in that point 7, detailed and objective conditions which, accordingly, alone are decisive for the purposes of identifying the photographs eligible for the reduced rate of VAT.</p>

Such criteria are sufficient to ensure that the application of the reduced rate of VAT only to photographs meeting those criteria is the exception to the application of the standard rate to any other photograph. As the Advocate General observed in point 24 of his Opinion, those criteria rule out the possibility that photographs might be classified as ‘works of art’ when they are mass produced, where printing is entrusted to specialist laboratories and the photographer does not have control over the final effect.</p>

However, the principle of fiscal neutrality precludes treating goods or supplies of services that are similar from the point of view of the typical consumer, which are thus in competition with each other, differently for VAT purposes (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 February 2014, Pro Med Logistik and Pongratz, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A111&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑454/12 and C‑455/12</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A111&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2014:111</a>, paragraphs <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A111&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point52" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">52</a> and <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A111&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point53" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">53</a>).</p>

Although that national legislation, as thus interpreted, provides that photographs depicting, inter alia, family events such as weddings do not, in principle, have artistic character, it does not exclude the possibility that such photographs might exceptionally have such character.
