<p class="normal">Contracting authorities should … be given the possibility to exclude economic operators which have proven unreliable, for instance because of violations of environmental or social obligations, including rules on accessibility for disabled persons or other forms of grave professional misconduct, such as violations of competition rules or of intellectual property rights. It should be clarified that grave professional misconduct can render an economic operator’s integrity questionable and thus render the economic operator unsuitable to receive the award of a public contract irrespective of whether the economic operator would otherwise have the technical and economical capacity to perform the contract.</p>
<p class="normal">Bearing in mind that the contracting authority will be responsible for the consequences of its possible erroneous decision, contracting authorities should also remain free to consider that there has been grave professional misconduct, where, before a final and binding decision on the presence of mandatory exclusion grounds has been rendered, they can demonstrate by any appropriate means that the economic operator has violated its obligations, including obligations relating to the payment of taxes or social security contributions, unless otherwise provided by national law. They should also be able to exclude candidates or tenderers whose performance in earlier public contracts has shown major deficiencies with regard to substantive requirements, for instance failure to deliver or perform, significant shortcomings of the product or service delivered, making it unusable for the intended purpose, or misbehaviour that casts serious doubts as to the reliability of the economic operator. National law should provide for a maximum duration for such exclusions.</p>
<p class="normal">In applying facultative grounds for exclusion, contracting authorities should pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality. Minor irregularities should only in exceptional circumstances lead to the exclusion of an economic operator. However repeated cases of minor irregularities can give rise to doubts about the reliability of an economic operator which might justify its exclusion.</p>

<p class="normal">Allowance should, however, be made for the possibility that economic operators can adopt compliance measures aimed at remedying the consequences of any criminal offences or misconduct and at effectively preventing further occurrences of the misbehaviour. Those measures might consist in particular of personnel and organisational measures such as the severance of all links with persons or organisations involved in the misbehaviour, appropriate staff reorganisation measures, the implementation of reporting and control systems, the creation of an internal audit structure to monitor compliance and the adoption of internal liability and compensation rules. Where such measures offer sufficient guarantees, the economic operator in question should no longer be excluded on those grounds alone. Economic operators should have the possibility to request that compliance measures taken with a view to possible admission to the procurement procedure be examined. However, it should be left to Member States to determine the exact procedural and substantive conditions applicable in such cases. They should, in particular, be free to decide whether to allow the individual contracting authorities to carry out the relevant assessments or to entrust other authorities on a central or decentralised level with that task.’</p>

<p class="normal">On 8 January 2018, Delta lodged a complaint with the Consiliul Național de Soluționare a Contestațiilor (National Council for the Resolution of Complaints, Romania; ‘the CNSC’), which was rejected by a decision of 2 February 2018. In that decision, the CNSC found that it did not have the power to analyse the lawfulness of the report, or to ascertain any misconduct in the performance of Contract No 1. It stated, however, that since the report had not been annulled by a final judgment, it benefited from a presumption of lawfulness such as to prove the serious breach of the contractual obligations under Contract No 1. The CNSC also noted that the contracting authority had not relied solely on that report in order to exclude Consortium No 2. It had taken steps in order to assess the information apparent from that report and relied on the observations of the parties to the main proceedings. Lastly, Consortium No 2 had relied solely on the alleged unlawfulness of the report, without adducing evidence of its own reliability in respect of the grounds of exclusion, as required by Article 171 of Law No 98/2016.</p>

The early termination of contract No 1 on the ground that part of the works was subcontracted without the contacting authority’s prior authorisation amounts to a minor irregularity, not a breach of a principal obligation of the contract. Consequently, such an irregularity could only in exceptional circumstances lead to an economic operator being excluded, in accordance with recital 101 of Directive 2014/24. In that regard, Delta refers to paragraph 30 of the judgment of 13 December 2012, Forposta and ABC Direct Contact (<a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A801&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑465/11</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A801&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2012:801</a>), from which it is apparent that the concept of ‘grave misconduct’ refers to conduct by the economic operator at issue which denotes a wrongful intent or negligence of a certain gravity on its part.</p>

It is apparent from that provision that, ‘in the procurement documents, the contracting authority may ask or may be required by a Member State to ask the tenderer to indicate in its tender any share of the contract it may intend to subcontract to third parties and any proposed subcontractors’. As the Advocate General observed in point 38 of his Opinion, it is only on the basis of that information that the contracting authority will be able to gauge whether the subcontractor is itself reliable.
