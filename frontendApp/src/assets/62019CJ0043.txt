According to the referring court, the existence of damage to that operator must be presumed. It follows also from Article 48(2)(c) and Article 52‑A(8) of the Law on electronic communications that the termination of the contract during the tie-in period justifies an amount by way of compensation, in order to ‘recover the costs associated with the terminal subsidies, the installation and activation of the service or other promotional conditions’.
