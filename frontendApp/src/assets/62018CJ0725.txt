That court states that, under those provisions, those transactions are no longer the only transactions subject to that tax, since the transactions ‘deemed to be concluded or executed in Belgium’ are also covered, with the result that that tax is also due if the purchase or sale order is issued to a non-resident professional intermediary by a resident issuer of an order, namely by ‘a natural person who has his habitual residence in Belgium’ or by a ‘legal person on behalf of a registered office or an establishment of that legal person in Belgium’. The referring court adds that, in the latter case, the issuer of an order becomes liable for the TOB instead of the professional intermediary, since non-resident professional intermediaries cannot be required to comply with the Belgian tax provisions. That issuer of an order is required to declare and pay that tax within two months of the transaction in question, unless he can establish that it has already been paid, either through the intermediary or his liable representative.</p>

<p class="normal">In that regard, Anton van Zantbeek claims that if an issuer of an order residing in Belgium uses a professional intermediary who is not established in that Member State, that issuer of an order will be treated as a professional intermediary, in so far as he will, first, be subject to the declaration and payment obligations of the TOB and, second, will be subject to administrative sanctions almost identical to those imposed on Belgian professional intermediaries. It would therefore be considerably more risky, costly and burdensome at an administrative level for such an issuer of an order who is resident in Belgium to use the services of a non-resident professional intermediary, which constitutes a restriction on the freedom to provide services and the free movement of capital, and cannot be justified by objectives in the public interest.</p>

<p class="normal">The Council of Ministers disputes that argument, stating that the tax scheme resulting from Articles 120 and 126/2 of the CDTD applies without distinction to all providers of stock exchange transactions, irrespective of their place of residence, but that only professional intermediaries established in Belgium are required to levy the TOB on the transactions executed. The situation of a resident issuer of an order using a resident professional intermediary is therefore not comparable to that of the same issuer of an order using a non-resident professional intermediary. In the alternative, the difference in treatment relied on is based on an objective criterion, pursues a legitimate aim and is not disproportionate.</p>

<p class="normal">The referring court points out that the Belgian legislature intended to extend the scope of the TOB in so far as, where an issuer of an order established in Belgium approached a non-resident professional intermediary, the transaction was generally executed in a foreign place, not rendering the tax chargeable. The legislature also found that there was unfair competition on the part of certain non-resident professional intermediaries in relation to Belgian professional intermediaries, who levy that tax. That court adds that Articles 120 and 126/2 of the CDTD could have the effect of restricting the freedom of Belgian residents to choose a professional intermediary to carry out their stock exchange transactions, having regard, in particular, to the liability which arises, for the issuer of an order, from the use of a non-resident professional intermediary in the event of non-payment or delay in making a declaration relating to the TOB or payment of that tax.</p>

The appointment of such a representative cannot, however, be imposed on those intermediaries. Furthermore, if the issuer of an order appointed a representative to fulfil its obligations under the TOB, the issuer of an order would remain liable to the Belgian State. The issuer of an order could establish that the tax was paid by producing an order statement (‘bordereau’) in accordance with Article 127 of the CDTD, indicating, inter alia, the value of the transaction forming the basis of that tax, and proof of payment to his intermediary, by means, for example, of a bank statement.</p>

Under those provisions, first, in addition to stock exchange transactions entered into or executed in Belgium, in so far as the transaction is executed through a professional intermediary, transactions which are ‘deemed to be concluded or executed’ in that Member State, that is to say, transactions whose order is given by a Belgian resident to a non-resident professional intermediary, are subject to that tax. Second, if the professional intermediary is established abroad, it is no longer the professional intermediary who is liable for the TOB payable by his client who issues an order and the declaration obligations that are a corollary of this, but the issuer of an order himself.</p>

<p class="normal">In the case in the main proceedings, it appears that the aspect of the freedom to provide services prevails over that of the free movement of capital. Although a tax such as the TOB is capable of affecting the free movement of capital in so far as it relates to stock exchange transactions, it is apparent from the information provided by the referring court that that tax applies only if a professional intermediary is involved in the transaction. In addition, the referring court is uncertain as to the restriction which may arise from the fact that the issuer of an order, if he uses a non-resident supplier of financial intermediation services, becomes liable to pay that tax, whereas that is not the case if that issuer of an order uses a resident supplier of services. Such an effect predominantly concerns the freedom to provide services, whereas its effect on the free movement of capital is merely an inevitable consequence of the possible restriction imposed on the provision of services.</p>

<p class="normal">It appears, moreover, that a resident issuer of an order may agree with the non-resident professional intermediary engaged by him that the latter wishes to provide that resident issuer of an order with a bank statement in respect of the transactions showing payment of the TOB, as intermediaries established in Belgium are obliged to do. The referring court also notes that a non-resident professional intermediary is able to appoint a representative for the purposes of carrying out those formalities.</p>

<p class="normal">It is also apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that, by the introduction of Article 126/3 of the CDTD, the Belgian legislature also sought to simplify the taking of evidence concerning payment of the TOB. That article allows, without obliging them to do so, non-resident intermediaries to have a representative established in Belgium approved for the purpose of fulfilling, on their behalf, the declaration obligations linked to the payment of that tax and who will be responsible for it. That option is such as to overcome the difficulty associated with the need to complete the order statement referred to in Article 127 of the CDTD in a language which is not that of the non-resident professional intermediary.</p>

<p class="normal">In those circumstances, such a choice of options, to the benefit of both resident issuers of an order and non-resident professional intermediaries, which allows them to adopt, from among those options, the solution which appears to them to be the least restrictive, limits the restriction on the freedom to provide services resulting from the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings to what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives which it pursues, so that that legislation, which thus offers those issuers of an order and the professional intermediaries options, both as regards the declaration obligations relating to the TOB and its payment, does not appear to go beyond what is necessary to achieve these objectives.</p>
