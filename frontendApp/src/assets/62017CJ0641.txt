CPP has argued that resident pension funds can receive dividends free of tax, as they are able, in the context of the tax assessment procedure, to set the tax on income from capital that has been withheld off against corporation tax or to obtain a refund of almost all of the former tax. Moreover, with regard to resident pension funds, CPP claims that allocations to provisions for pension commitments are taken into account as professional expenses, which makes it possible to reduce the amount of corporation tax when the latter is determined under a tax assessment procedure. According to CPP, non‑resident pension funds cannot effect such set-offs or obtain such refunds, since, for such pension funds, the corporation tax paid by way of withholding tax has a discharging effect, in accordance with Paragraph 32(1) No 2 of the KStG, and constitutes a definitive tax burden in relation to them.</p>

<p class="normal">For its part, the defendant in the main proceedings maintains, first of all, that, while German pension funds could set the tax on income from capital that has been paid off against the corporation tax due, this does not amount to a complete exemption, since the dividends received are subject to corporation tax, at a rate of 15% of taxable income. Next, that defendant maintains that it is not possible to take the view that a non-resident pension fund is treated less favourably than resident pension funds on the ground that the national legislation deprives non‑resident funds of the possibility of deducting professional expenses, since, in the absence of any direct connection between such provisions for pension commitments and the activity generating the income in question, those funds are not in a situation comparable to resident pension funds. Moreover, any restriction is, in any event, justified on grounds of the effectiveness of fiscal supervision. Lastly, the defendant contends that a restriction is permissible under Article 64(1) TFEU, since the discharging effect provided for in Paragraph 32(1) No 2 of the KStG had already been established by Paragraph 50(2) of the KStG of 1977 and the income distributed involved a provision of financial services by the pension fund to its investors.</p>

It wonders whether the national legislation establishes a difference in treatment between those funds, contrary to Articles 63 and 65 TFEU, since under national legislation partially taxable non‑resident pension funds are not able to set the tax on income from capital off against the corporation tax payable by those funds or to obtain reimbursement of the tax on income from capital, whereas resident pension funds are able to do so and whereas, for the latter funds, the receipt of dividends does not lead to an increase in corporation tax due or only a comparatively small one, since they can deduct from the taxable profit allocations to provisions for pension commitments.</p>

<p class="normal">It is true that, as regards the possibility of deducting from the taxable profit allocations to provisions for pension commitments, there is no rule under German law similar to that at issue in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 8 November 2012, Commission v Finland (<a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A688&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑342/10</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A688&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=null" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2012:688</a>), a rule expressly providing that allocations to the mathematical provisions and similar technical provisions may be deducted from taxable income as deductible expenses. However, according to the German legislation, only the increase in the net assets of a company liable to tax is taxed over the course of a tax year. When dividends are paid to a pension fund, the assets of the pension fund increase only if, and to the extent that, the returns on non-accounting investments are not credited to the various pension fund agreements. Since the dividends distributed increase the mathematical provisions and/or other items on the liabilities side, the profits of the pension fund remain unchanged, with the result that there is no taxable increase in assets. Consequently, the provisions for pension commitments, which reduce the taxable profit, are the direct consequence of the receipt of the dividends, so that, according to the national court, resident and non‑resident pension funds are in a comparable situation with regard to the taking into account of allocations to the mathematical and similar technical provisions as professional expenses.</p>

It states that some academics consider that capital inflows into the pension fund do not on their own have a sufficiently close connection with the provision of financial services provided by a non‑resident pension fund for the benefit of insured persons. However, it points out that, because of the particularities of pension fund activity, returns on investments made by a pension fund increase, for the most part, in parallel with the pension fund’s pension payment liabilities, so that the taxation of the dividends distributed has a direct impact on the claims of insured persons against the pension fund.</p>

The tax on income from capital, levied by a withholding tax of 25% of the gross dividend, is set off against the corporation tax thus established, so that the withholding tax is refunded at a rate of 10% of the gross dividend. In principle, the tax burden remains equal to 15% of the gross dividend.
