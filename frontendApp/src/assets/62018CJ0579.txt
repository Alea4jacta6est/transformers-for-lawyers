Article 38(3) of that directive provides that, in such cases, ‘the excise duty shall be due from the person who guaranteed payment thereof in accordance with Article 34(2)(a) or Article 36(4)(a) and from any person who participated in the irregularity.</p>

<p class="normal">This literal interpretation, on which it is possible to hold a legal person jointly and severally liable to pay excise duty together, potentially, with other persons who participated in the same irregularity, is supported by Article 8 of Directive 2008/118, which identifies the persons liable to pay excise duty that has become chargeable. Indeed, paragraph 2 of that article provides that where several persons are liable for payment of one excise duty debt, they are jointly and severally liable for such debt.</p>

<p class="normal">This interpretation is also supported by the preparatory work relating to Directive 2008/118. As the Commission has pointed out, the initial draft of the directive limited the list of persons who, in the event of irregular introduction of goods into a Member State, would be liable for the excise duty, to those who had guaranteed the payment of such duty. However, the Council of the European Union wished to extend this list so as to include ‘any person who participated in the irregularity’, as Article 38(3) of the directive provides. In adopting that wording, the intention of the EU legislature was thus to lay down a broad definition as to the persons potentially liable to pay excise duty in cases of irregularity so as to ensure, as far as possible, that such duty was collected.</p>
