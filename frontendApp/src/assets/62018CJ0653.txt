<p class="normal">In the period from January 2007 to May 2007, Unitel, a company established in Poland, sold mobile telephones to two Ukrainian entities. Following an audit carried out on that company, the tax authorities found that the procedure for the exportation of those mobile telephones to a destination outside the territory of the European Union had been carried out, but that those goods had not been acquired by the entities stated on the invoices but by other entities which were not identified. Those authorities thus found, by a decision confirmed by a decision of the Director of the Tax Chamber dated 29 August 2014, that there had been no supply of goods within the meaning of Article 2(8) of the Law on VAT and, therefore, that Unitel was not entitled to apply the 0% rate of VAT provided for in Article 41(4) of that Law.</p>

<p class="normal">The Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny w Warszawie (Regional Administrative Court, Warsaw, Poland), seised of an appeal against the decision of the Director of the Tax Chamber, noted that it was apparent from the findings made that one of the two Ukrainian entities was a shell company, serving to conceal the actual recipient and to perpetrate tax fraud against both the Polish and Ukrainian tax authorities, and that the other entity was not the economic operator which had acquired the telephones from Unitel. That court found that there had been no supply of goods since the tax authorities had established that the persons acquiring the goods mentioned on the invoices had not entered into possession of those goods, had not disposed of those goods as owner and did not carry out any economic activity, so therefore the transactions at issue could not be characterised as an ‘export of goods’ within the meaning of Article 2(8) of the Law on VAT. That court also held that Unitel had not exercised due diligence when conducting those transactions. It observed, inter alia, in that regard that that company had drawn up its invoices based on data submitted by entities whose mandates were not valid or which did not possess genuine business addresses or valid documents providing proof of VAT accounting.</p>

<p class="normal">Unitel brought an appeal against the judgment of the Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny w Warszawie (Regional Administrative Court, Warsaw) before the referring court, the Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny (Supreme Administrative Court, Poland). In support of its appeal, Unitel pleads incorrect interpretation and application of Article 131 of the VAT Directive, read in conjunction with Article 146(1)(a) and (b) thereof, inasmuch as the application of the rate of 0% was held subject to compliance with formal conditions even though all the substantive conditions for the application of that rate were satisfied, and an error of interpretation and application of Article 41(4) and (11) of the Law on VAT, read in conjunction with Article 41(6), Article 2(8) and Article 7(1) of that Law. That error, in Unitel’s view, consists in having found that the supply of goods is effective only when the operator mentioned on the invoice as the person acquiring the goods is the same as the operator which actually takes part in the transaction at issue in that capacity, and in refusing as a result to treat that transaction as an export of goods and to apply the rate of 0%, and in finding nevertheless that that transaction constitutes a supply taxable at the national rate.</p>

<p class="normal">According to the referring court, the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings requires it to interpret the VAT Directive and, above all, the concept of ‘supply of goods’ within the meaning of Article 146(1)(a) and (b) of that directive. It states that the national tax authorities submit that that concept must be interpreted in accordance with Article 7(1) of the Law on VAT, which transposed Article 14(1) of the VAT Directive, namely as the transfer of the right to dispose of the goods as owner. Thus, according to those authorities, the two parties to the transaction must actually exist and be identified, which is not the case when the person acquiring the goods designates a fictitious entity on the invoice or customs documents or when the person acquiring the goods outside the territory of the European Union is a different person who is not identified. That interpretation is also the interpretation accepted by the majority of the Polish administrative courts.</p>

<p class="normal">The referring court is nevertheless uncertain as to whether, in order to find that a supply of goods to a destination outside the territory of the European Union indeed took place, where the export per se of those goods is not disputed, it is in fact necessary that the entity designated on the supplier’s invoice and the customs documents as the person acquiring those goods must be the same as the actual recipient of those goods. It raises the issue of whether, in such a situation, there is a transfer of the right to dispose of tangible property as owner, within the meaning of Article 14(1) of the VAT Directive. It observes, inter alia, that in the judgment of 19 December 2013, BDV Hungary Trading (<a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A854&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑563/12</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A854&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2013:854</a>), the Court held that, in circumstances where the conditions for the exemption on exportation laid down in Article 146(1)(b) of the VAT Directive, in particular, the requirement that the goods concerned leave the customs territory of the European Union, are satisfied, no liability to pay VAT arises in respect of a supply and that, in those circumstances, there no longer exists, in principle, a risk of tax evasion or loss of tax which could justify the transaction concerned being taxed.</p>

<p class="normal">In that context, the issue then arises, in the referring court’s view, of knowing to what extent possible tax evasion, which occurs in the territory of the non-Member State where the goods exported were received by a person other than that indicated on the customs documents, affects the applicability of the exemption with the right to deduct VAT. Examining the case-law of the Court according to which it is for the Member States to refuse to grant the rights provided for in the VAT Directive in the event of tax evasion committed by the taxable person himself or where that person knew or ought to have known that, by the transaction at issue, he was participating in a transaction which was part of a VAT fraud, it raises the issue of whether that obligation, which is aimed at protecting the internal market, applies where the tax evasion is committed only in a non-Member State, that being the State of destination and consumption of the goods exported.</p>

<p class="normal">In the judgment of 19 December 2013, BDV Hungary Trading (<a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A854&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑563/12</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A854&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2013:854</a>), cited by the referring court, the Court observed, in paragraph 40 thereof, that in circumstances where the conditions for the exemption on exportation laid down in Article 146(1)(b) of the VAT Directive, in particular, the requirement that the goods concerned leave the customs territory of the European Union, are satisfied, no liability to pay VAT arises in respect of such a supply and there no longer exists, in principle, a risk of tax evasion or loss of tax which could justify the transaction concerned being taxed.</p>

<p class="normal">In the present case the referring court, without providing further details on the nature of the fraud of which the transactions at issue in the main proceedings were allegedly part, indicates that the goods covered by those transactions left the territory of the European Union and observes that that fraud was committed only on the territory of a non-Member State, that being the State of destination and the place of consumption of those goods.</p>

<p class="normal">Since the fact that the fraudulent acts were committed in a non-Member State is not such as to be sufficient to rule out the existence of any tax evasion committed to the detriment of the common system of VAT, it is for the national court to verify that the transactions at issue in the main proceedings were not part of any such fraud and, if they were, to assess whether the taxable person knew or ought to have known that that was the case.</p>

<p class="normal">In the light of all these considerations, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article 146(1)(a) and (b) and Article 131 of the VAT Directive and the principles of fiscal neutrality and proportionality must be interpreted as precluding a national practice, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which consists in considering in all cases that there is no supply of goods, within the meaning of that former provision, and in refusing as a result the VAT exemption, where the goods concerned were exported to a destination outside the European Union and where, following their exportation, the tax authorities found that the person acquiring those goods was not the person stated on the invoice issued by the taxable person but another entity which has not been identified. In such circumstances, the VAT exemption provided for in Article 146(1)(a) and (b) of that directive must be refused if the failure to identify the person actually acquiring the goods prevents it from being proved that the transaction at issue constitutes a supply of goods within the meaning of that provision or if it is established that that taxable person knew or ought to have known that that transaction was part of a fraud committed to the detriment of the common system of VAT.</p>
