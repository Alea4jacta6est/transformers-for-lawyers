The Commission thus considers that the conflict of interest between, on the one hand, the activity of IPCF accountant and, on the other, the activities of an insurance broker or agent, or of an estate agent, or banking or financial services activities is not demonstrated and, in any event, cannot be more serious than that taken into consideration in that judgment.</p>

In that regard, the Kingdom of Belgium states that estate agents, insurance brokers and stock exchange agents are remunerated on the basis of a commission, the amount of which may prove to be higher than the fees derived from accounting activities, so that a conflict of interest could arise if the accountant took account of considerations other than those exclusively related to the interests of his client.</p>
