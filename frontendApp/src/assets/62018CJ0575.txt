By refusing to make that amount available to that institution, the Member State runs the risk of having to pay interest in addition to the principal amount if, following the commencement of infringement proceedings by the Commission, the Court of Justice were to find that there had been a failure to fulfil the obligation to make own resources available. The amount of interest due depends in practice on the period within which the Commission brings such an action and the duration of the infringement procedure. The amount could thus be very high and would constitute an excessive legal expense for the Member State concerned.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In that regard it must be recalled that the Court has held that, according to the principles common to the laws of the Member States, a person who has suffered a loss which increases the wealth of another person without there being any legal basis for that enrichment has the right, as a general rule, to restitution from the person enriched, up to the amount of the loss. While the FEU Treaty does not make express provision for a means of pursuing that type of action, if Article 268 TFEU and the second paragraph of Article 340 TFEU were to be construed as excluding that possibility, the result would be contrary to the principle of effective judicial protection. Actions for unjust enrichment of the European Union, brought under those articles, require proof of enrichment on the part of the defendant for which there is no valid legal basis and proof of impoverishment on the part of the applicant which is linked to that enrichment (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 December 2008, Masdar (UK) v Commission, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A726&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑47/07 P</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A726" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2008:726</a>, paragraphs <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A726" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">44</a> and <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A726" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">46</a> to <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A726" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">50</a>).</p>
