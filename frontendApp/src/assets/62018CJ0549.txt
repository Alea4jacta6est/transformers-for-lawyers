Since the measures notified by Romania in October 2018 do not transpose Directive 2015/849, but Directives 2005/60 and 2006/70, they cannot be taken into consideration in the context of the present proceedings.

Since those 40 measures ensured that Directives 2005/60 and 2006/70 — which were, in large measure, incorporated into Directive 2015/849 which repealed them — were transposed in full, they had to be regarded as transposing Directive 2015/849 in part.

Indeed, the correlation table annexed to the defence states clearly and concisely the provisions of Directive 2015/849 considered transposed as well as the corresponding provisions of the national legislation in force. The fact that those same measures do not include a reference to that directive does not preclude them from being transposition measures, because they enable the objectives pursued by that directive to be attained.</p>

Consequently, the policy decision to make use of the instrument provided for by Article 260(3) TFEU as a matter of principle in all cases of failure to fulfil an obligation covered by that provision was taken in the exercise of the Commission’s discretionary power.

The objective of that provision is to penalise, at an earlier stage, a manifest failure to fulfil an obligation the manner of compliance with which is indisputable, namely the notification of the measures transposing directives. Article 260(3) TFEU is, therefore, directed at clear infringements in the light of which the prior obtaining of a judgment of the Court declaring the failure to fulfil obligations is only a formal step. The application of that provision should be limited to the situations exhaustively set out in the wording thereof, namely the failure to fulfil ‘the obligation to notify measures transposing a directive’.</p>

However, where Member States adopt transposition measures or, as in the present case, prove that such measures, albeit only partial ones, exist, an exchange of arguments between the Commission and the Member State concerned, which cannot be placed on the same footing as a formal step, is as a general rule required in order to establish a failure to fulfil obligations.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">As regards the financial penalty sought, Romania notes, first, that the Commission did not state reasons for its decision to request the imposition of such a penalty in the present case. The Commission’s practice of automatically requesting financial penalties to be applied under Article 260(3) TFEU in actions for failure to fulfil the obligation to notify the measures transposing a directive is erroneous and is contrary to the objectives pursued by that provision. It is apparent from the very wording of the provision that the Commission ‘may, when it deems appropriate, specify the amount of the lump sum or penalty payment’ to be paid by the Member State concerned, so that the application of financial penalties is an option open to the Commission, which must analyse each situation individually. Consequently, it is for the Commission to analyse all the factual and legal circumstances of the present case and to state reasons, in the light of those circumstances, for its decision to request the Court to apply financial penalties. Compliance with that obligation is all the more important since it is apparent from Article 260(3) TFEU that the Court may only impose a penalty not exceeding the amount specified by the Commission, so that, in the absence of a proposal of such an amount from the Commission, the Court is precluded from imposing a financial penalty. In the light of the foregoing and taking into account all the factual and legal circumstances of the present case and the fact that the Commission has failed to state reasons for its decision to request the application of financial penalties, Romania contends that such penalties cannot be applied in the present case.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Romania contends, secondly, that the imposition of a lump sum constitutes an exception, which applies only when it is apparent from the characteristics of the failure to fulfil obligations at issue, the conduct of the Member State concerned and the assessment of the degree of prejudice to the public and private interests that the application of a periodic penalty payment is insufficient with regard to the objective of putting an end to that failure to fulfil obligations as soon as possible and ensuring that that Member State will not persist in such conduct. Indeed, the Court has held that, in the light of the wording and purpose of Article 260(3) TFEU, an order for the payment of a lump sum should not be made automatically, as the Commission suggests. In the present case, first of all, the Commission has accepted that, in the course of the proceedings before the Court, Romania adopted all the measures necessary to ensure that Directive 2015/849 was transposed in full. Next, even before Legea nr. 129/2019 pentru prevenirea și combaterea spălării banilor și finanțării terorismului, precum și pentru modificarea și completarea unor acte normative (Law No 129/2019 on the prevention and suppression of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, amending and supplementing certain legislative acts), of 11 July 2019 (<span class="coj-italic">Monitorul Oficial al României</span>, Part I, No 589 of 18 July 2019), entered into force on 21 July 2019, the provisions of Directive 2015/849 relating to the effects on private and public actors had already been transposed by national legislative acts in force. In addition, for certain obligations laid down in that directive, the transposition period was not yet expired. Lastly, Romania is an average Member State as regards the number of actions for failure to fulfil the obligation to notify the measures transposing directives and thus far has never been found by the Court to have failed to fulfil the obligation to transpose a directive within the prescribed period. Furthermore, the average duration of the pre-litigation procedures involving Romania is the shortest of all the Member States and, in the present case, less than one year elapsed between the commencement of the pre-litigation procedure and the bringing of proceedings before the Court. Consequently, the Commission’s request for a lump sum to be imposed is not only unjustified, but also disproportionate in the light of the facts of the case and the essential aim of that type of financial penalty.</p>

In addition, they contend that that interpretation is borne out by the scheme adopted within Article 260 TFEU itself and is the only interpretation which does not put the Member States in an extremely difficult situation given that, if the approach advocated by the Commission were followed, the Member States could never be certain that the Commission was not considering imposing a penalty payment on them.</p>

Specific reasons for such a decision must be provided in relation to the particular circumstances of each case, since a lump sum may not, in accordance with the case-law of the Court, be imposed automatically. The Commission cannot simply make use, as a matter of principle, of the instrument laid down in Article 260(3) TFEU, without infringing that provision. In addition, a detailed analysis of the elements of each case by the Commission is required since those elements are necessary in order to determine the nature of the financial penalty which should be imposed to prompt the Member State concerned to put an end to the failure to fulfil obligations at issue and in order to establish an amount which is appropriate to the circumstances of the case, as required by the case-law of the Court. It is also unnecessary to aggregate the payment of a lump sum with the payment of a periodic penalty.

The daily amount is, therefore, EUR 6 016.80 per day and should be multiplied by the number of days which have elapsed between 27 June 2017, that is the day following the transposition date provided for in Directive 2015/849, and 20 July 2019, the day preceding the date on which that directive was transposed in full, namely 754 days.

As regards the coefficient for duration, Romania contends that it is inappropriate to choose such a coefficient, since the concept of the ‘duration of the infringement’ is fundamentally dependent on the date on which the infringement in question is declared by the Court. In the context of Article 260(3) TFEU, that date is indeed the date of delivery of the Court’s judgment in accordance with Article 258 TFEU. Should the Court not follow that approach, Romania contends that, in order to determine the duration of the infringement, it would be appropriate to take as the reference date the date set in the reasoned opinion, in accordance with the Court’s practice in failures to fulfil obligations under Article 258 TFEU.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Having regard to the specific characteristics of the action brought by the Commission on the basis of Article 258 TFEU in conjunction with Article 260(3) TFEU, Romania also contends that it would be more appropriate to establish a minimum amount and a maximum amount of lump sum varying according to the seriousness of the infringement committed by the Member State in question. In order to determine those amounts, all the relevant circumstances should be taken into account. First, a minimum lump sum should be set, well below the Commission’s current proposal, which would apply where the attitude of the Member State concerned has been constructive and cooperative and the infringement is less serious. Secondly, the maximum lump sum should reflect the opposite attitude of the Member State concerned and a more serious infringement. In the present case, the minimum lump sum of EUR 1887000 proposed by the Commission is disproportionate in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, Romania’s attitude and conduct and the new minimum lump sum of EUR 1651000 proposed in the Commission’s communication of 13 September 2019, entitled ‘Updating of data used to calculate lump sum and penalty payments to be proposed by the Commission to the Court of Justice of the European Union in infringement proceedings’ (<a href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:C:2019:309:TOC" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';">OJ 2019 C 309, p. 1</a>). Consequently, should the Court impose a lump sum, it should be reduced considerably and also reflect the fact that, although Law No 129/2019 of 11 July 2019 did not enter into force until 21 July 2019, Directive 2015/849 had already been partially transposed even before the period for transposing it had expired. In addition, even if the Court decided to follow the approach advocated by the Commission, the amount of the lump sum should be reduced by taking into account only the number of days elapsed between the deadline set in the reasoned opinion, that is 8 February 2018 and, as appropriate, the date of cessation of the infringement at issue or the date on which the present judgment is delivered.</p>

First, as pointed out in that paragraph, it is for the Commission, in particular, to assess whether or not proceedings should be brought against a Member State and to choose the time at which it initiates the infringement proceedings against that Member State. Secondly, the aims of the pre-litigation procedure, namely to give the Member State concerned an opportunity to comply with its obligations under EU law and to avail itself of its right to defend itself against the objections formulated by the Commission (judgment of 19 September 2017, Commission v Ireland (Registration tax), <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A698&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑552/15</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A698" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2017:698</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2017%3A698" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">28</a> and the case-law cited), require the Commission to allow Member States a reasonable period to reply to letters of formal notice and to comply with reasoned opinions, or, where appropriate, to prepare their defence. In order to determine whether the period allowed is reasonable, account must be taken of all the circumstances of the case. Thus, very short periods may be justified in particular circumstances, especially where there is an urgent need to remedy a breach or where the Member State concerned is fully aware of the Commission’s views long before the procedure starts (judgment of 13 December 2001, Commission v France, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2001%3A687&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑1/00</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2001%3A687" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2001:687</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2001%3A687" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">65</a>).</p>
