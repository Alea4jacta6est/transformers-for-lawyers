On the basis of those invoices, it was calculated that VAT amounting to EUR 30590 was deductible. Mr Astone contends that those invoices should be taken into account, in accordance with the case-law of the Court relating to the right to deduct VAT paid on inputs by a taxable person. Taking into account that amount of VAT deductible and a previous tax credit, the amount of tax evaded would not exceed the EUR 30000 threshold laid down in Article 5(1) of Legislative Decree No 74 and, consequently, there would no longer be any infringement which could be punished under that provision.

In the present case, the ‘tax due’, including for the purposes of determining whether criminal proceedings may be brought under that provision, is therefore, in the referring court’s view, that resulting from the invoices issued. The referring court considers that the possibility of taking into account the VAT paid as input tax presupposes that the right to deduct has been exercised when the annual return was made and is only in respect of the purchase invoices which were recorded in the relevant register.</p>

Those judgments do not, however, specify the requirements in question and in particular which formal obligations must be discharged in each case in order for the taxable person to be able to enjoy his right to deduct. Since Mr Astone has not satisfied any formal obligation, an answer from the Court is necessary in order to rule on his criminal liability.</p>

<p class="normal">In proceedings brought under Article 267 TFEU, the Court has no jurisdiction to check or to assess the factual circumstances of the case in the main proceedings. It is therefore for the referring court to carry out, in accordance with the rules of evidence under national law, an overall assessment of all the evidence and factual circumstances of those proceedings in order to determine, in the light of the objective evidence provided to it, whether the defendant in the main proceedings has committed such an evasion or abuse (see, by analogy, judgment of 13 February 2014 in Maks Pen, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A69&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑18/13</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A69&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2014:69</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A69&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point30" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">30</a>). However, in order to give the national court a useful answer, the Court may, in a spirit of cooperation with national courts, provide it with all the guidance that it deems necessary (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 July 2013 in AES-3C Maritza East 1, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A488&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑124/12</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A488&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2013:488</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A488&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point42" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">42</a>, and 3 September 2014 in GMAC UK, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2131&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑589/12</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2131&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2014:2131</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2131&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point46" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">46</a>).</p>

<p class="normal">In particular, the failure to file a VAT return, like to failure to keep accounting records, which would allow VAT to be applied and monitored by the tax authorities, and the failure to record the invoices issued and paid are liable to prevent the correct collection of the tax and, therefore, to compromise the proper functioning of the common system of VAT. Therefore, EU law does not prevent Member States from treating such infringements as amounting to tax evasion and from refusing to grant the right to deduct in such cases (see, by analogy, judgment of 7 December 2010 in R., <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A742&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑285/09</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A742&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2010:742</a>, paragraphs <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A742&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point48" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">48</a> and <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A742&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point49" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">49</a>).</p>
