Under that system, the outstanding amount of the DTI carried forward must be deducted as a priority over the outstanding amount of the deferred DRC. Therefore, according to that court, by reason of the order in which tax deductions are to be applied as set out in the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, the deduction of DTI is likely to result in a heavier tax burden than would be the case in a scheme which immediately excluded dividends declared by the subsidiary.</p>

<p class="normal">Furthermore, as noted in paragraph 32 above, the Kingdom of Belgium opted, in transposing Directive 90/435, for the exemption scheme set out in the first indent of Article 4(1) of that directive and chose to implement that scheme by providing for dividends to be included in the parent company’s tax base and subsequently deducted from that base and for the possibility of carrying forward DTI to subsequent tax years, with a view to their being deducted as a priority. That choice necessarily implies an interaction between dividends and other elements of the tax base, such as the DRC. In those circumstances, the effects of that interaction must comply with Directive 90/435, irrespective of the fact that establishing the order in which tax deductions are to be applied and the time limit for carrying forward the DRC are solely a matter of national competence.</p>

<p class="normal">Finally, the Belgian Government states that, where there are still profits at the stage at which the DRC may be deducted, it has already been possible to deduct the DTI from the parent company’s profits, so that the prior inclusion in its tax base of dividends distributed by its non-resident subsidiary has been fully offset for tax purposes by an amount equal to the DTI deducted.</p>

<p class="normal">However, that observation only seeks to establish that the dividends have not been taxed directly, in themselves. As pointed out in paragraphs 33 and 37 above, the first indent of Article 4(1) of Directive 90/435 precludes, subject only to what is permitted by Article 4(2) and (3), both direct taxation of the parent company in respect of profits distributed by its subsidiary and situations in which the parent company is indirectly taxed on dividends received from its subsidiary. As stated in paragraph 45 et seq. above, the receipt of dividends, in connection with the application of a tax regime such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may, in certain situations, result in the loss of a tax advantage, which in turn may result in higher taxation of the parent company than would be the case if such dividends had been excluded from its tax base. Since the parent company’s tax burden is likely to be affected, it must be concluded that the parent company is, as a result, indirectly taxed on the dividends received from its subsidiary.</p>
