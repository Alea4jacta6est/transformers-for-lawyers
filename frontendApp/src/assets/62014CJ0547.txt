Evidence demonstrates that the effectiveness of health warnings and messages increases with their prominence.

Larger picture warnings are also more likely to retain their effectiveness over time and are particularly effective in communicating health effects to low-literacy populations, children and young people. Other elements that enhance effectiveness include locating health warnings and messages on principal display areas, and at the top of these principal display areas; the use of colour rather than just black and white; requiring that multiple health warnings and messages appear concurrently; and periodic revision of health warnings and messages.’</p>

<p class="normal">The lack of a harmonised approach to regulating the ingredients of tobacco products affects the smooth functioning of the internal market and has a negative impact on the free movement of goods across the Union. Some Member States have adopted legislation or entered into binding agreements with the industry allowing or prohibiting certain ingredients. As a result, some ingredients are regulated in some Member States, but not in others. Member States also take differing approaches as regards additives in the filters of cigarettes as well as additives colouring the tobacco smoke. Without harmonisation, the obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market are expected to increase in the coming years, taking into account the implementation of the FCTC and the relevant FCTC guidelines throughout the Union and in the light of experience gained in other jurisdictions outside the Union. The FCTC guidelines in relation to the regulation of the contents of tobacco products and regulation of tobacco product disclosures call in particular for the removal of ingredients that increase palatability, create the impression that tobacco products have health benefits, are associated with energy and vitality or have colouring properties.</p>

<p class="normal">The labelling provisions should also be adapted to new scientific evidence. For example, the indication of the emission levels for tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide on unit packets of cigarettes has proven to be misleading as it leads consumers to believe that certain cigarettes are less harmful than others. Evidence also suggests that large combined health warnings comprised of a text warning and a corresponding colour photograph are more effective than warnings consisting only of text. As a consequence, combined health warnings should become mandatory throughout the Union and cover significant and visible parts of the surface of unit packets. Minimum dimensions should be set for all health warnings to ensure their visibility and effectiveness.</p>

Other misleading elements might include, but are not limited to, inserts or other additional material such as adhesive labels, stickers, onserts, scratch-offs and sleeves or relate to the shape of the tobacco product itself.

There is, moreover, disagreement between the claimants in the main proceedings and the Secretary of State for Health as to whether or not the abovementioned claims are well founded.

<p class="normal">It must be observed in this regard that Article 24(2) of Directive 2014/40 may in fact lend itself to several interpretations, and consequently the precise extent of the power granted to the Member States is not entirely unambiguous. First, the directive does not contain a definition of the expressions ‘further requirements’ and ‘standardisation’, which are used in Article 24(2). Secondly, Article 24(2) does not indicate whether or not that power extends to aspects of the packaging of tobacco products which have been harmonised by Directive 2014/40.</p>

<p class="normal">Whilst it is true that some provisions of Chapter II of Title II of Directive 2014/40 require that certain elements of the labelling and packaging of tobacco products are adapted to take account of, amongst other things, the official language(s) or the tax legislation of the Member State of marketing, the fact remains that the directive harmonises other elements of the labelling and packaging of those products, such as the shape of the unit packets, the minimum number of cigarettes per unit packet and the size and combined nature of health warnings. As the Advocate General has observed in point 98 of her Opinion, those measures thus contribute to the removal of obstacles to trade, since they allow the undertakings concerned to reduce costs through economies of scale.</p>

Secondly, it is argued that the disputed requirements will prevent the differentiation of tobacco products and will cause distortions of competition.

Similarly, certain packet shapes may obstruct the visibility of health warnings and, as a consequence, reduce their efficacy, as is stated in recitals 25 and 28 of Directive 2014/40. As regards the requirement that a unit packet must contain at least 20 cigarettes, it can be explained by the fact that smaller sales units are more of an inducement to start smoking because the consumer is inclined to think that they are cheaper, less of a constraint and psychologically more acceptable.</p>
