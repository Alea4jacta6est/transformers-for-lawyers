<p class="normal">In support of its request, KA Deka submits that the Opinion of the Advocate General contains an inaccuracy regarding the interpretation of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (<a href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1995:281:TOC" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';">OJ 1995 L 281, p. 31</a>). KA Deka argues that, contrary to what the Advocate General states in points 79 to 81 of his Opinion, Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 does not have horizontal direct effect authorising a non-public body to request or provide personal data to another non-public body. That inaccuracy has a decisive influence on the Court’s decision and thus justifies the reopening of the oral part of the procedure.</p>
