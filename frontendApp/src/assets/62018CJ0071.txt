They disagree, however, as to the interpretation to be given to Directive 2006/112 and offer three different classifications for those transactions. While, in the view of KPC Herning, each of the transactions should be classified as a ‘supply of a former building’ within the meaning of Article 135(1)(j) of that directive, the Danish Government considers that they should be classified as a ‘supply of building land’, within the meaning of Article 12(1)(b) of that directive. The Commission, for its part, distinguishes between the two transactions at issue and is of the view that the first transaction relates to the supply of a former building. The second transaction, however, is not merely a simple sale, but includes the construction of new buildings. It must therefore be classified as a ‘supply of a building and the land on which it stands’, before its first occupation, within the meaning of Article 12(1)(a) of the directive.</p>

In the present case, it is therefore necessary to determine whether and to what extent it is appropriate to take account of the intention to demolish part of the existing building used as a warehouse constructed on the land known as ‘Finlandkaj 12’ and to replace it with a new building.</p>

In the light of those factors, it held that, despite the economic links between all the transactions at issue and their common purpose, which consisted of the construction of a building on the land acquired, it was not appropriate, in the circumstances of that case, to classify them as a single transaction.</p>

Following that supply, the vendor, KPC Herning, was not at all involved in the partial demolition of the warehouse. The purchaser instructed, at its own expense and risk, a third-party undertaking to carry out the necessary works.
