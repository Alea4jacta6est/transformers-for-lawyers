According to those authorities, Aures is, as a Czech tax resident, taxable on its worldwide income under Czech tax law. However, it can deduct from the tax base only a loss arising from an economic activity in the Czech Republic determined in accordance with the Law on income tax, since that law does not govern the deduction of a tax loss in the event of a change in tax residency and does not provide for the transfer of such a loss from any Member State other than the Czech Republic.</p>
