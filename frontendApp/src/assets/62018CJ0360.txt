However, it also follows from the request for a preliminary ruling, in essence, that, according to the referring court, the definitive nature of a tax assessment notice under German law precludes a request for reimbursement based on Regulation No 1360/2013, where the applicable limitation period has expired at the time when that request is made.</p>

In that context, it is necessary, inter alia, to take into consideration, where relevant, the principle of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of the procedure (judgments of 20 October 2016, Danqua, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A789&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑429/15</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A789&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=null" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2016:789</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A789&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=null&amp;anchor=#point42" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">42</a>, and of 22 February 2018, INEOS Köln, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A100&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑572/16</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A100&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=null" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:100</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A100&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=null&amp;anchor=#point44" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">44</a>).</p>

According to the request for a preliminary ruling, that is the case notwithstanding the fact that Regulation No 1360/2013 amended EU law with retroactive effect by replacing the provisions of the regulations previously declared invalid by the Court, on which the decisions setting the charges and the corresponding tax notices were based. That retroactive amendment follows from the second, third and fourth paragraphs of Article 3 of that regulation, which sets the dates from which the production levies in the sugar sector set out in point 1 of the annex to that regulation apply for each of the marketing years at issue in the main proceedings.</p>
