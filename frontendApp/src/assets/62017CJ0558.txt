In that regard, the appellant mentions, inter alia, the fact that the report refers to her complicated relationship with her head of division at the relevant time, her difficulty in accepting any form of criticism and her eagerness to advance in her career; in her opinion, those matters are not directly necessary for the purpose of determining whether she had been a victim of sexual harassment.
