The calculation of the compensation due to the creditor should be transparent and comprehensible to consumers already at the pre-contractual stage and in any case during the performance of the credit agreement.

In its view, that interpretation would make it possible to protect the interests of consumers and would ensure a balance between the parties. The creditor could, in the case of early repayment of the contract, re-use the sum repaid in order to grant a new credit and thus benefit from a new commission. Moreover, the opposite solution might lead to a practice in which creditors would apply only costs which, formally, are not dependent on the duration of the credit agreement, in order to prevent them from being concerned by the reduction in the total cost of the credit.</p>

In the present case, the claims which are the subject of the disputes in the main proceedings are derived from three consumer credit agreements concluded between three consumers and the three defendants in the main proceedings, and were assigned to the applicant in the main proceedings following the early repayment of those agreements.</p>

<p class="normal">So far as concerns the ‘total cost of the credit’, Article 3(g) of that directive defines it as all the costs, including interest, commissions, taxes and any other kind of fees which the consumer is required to pay in connection with the credit agreement and which are known to the creditor, except for notarial costs. That definition does not therefore contain any restriction relating to the duration of the credit agreement at issue.</p>

<p class="normal">It is not possible to determine the exact extent of the reduction in the total cost of the credit provided for in Article 16(1) of Directive 2008/48 from a comparative analysis of the different language versions of that provision. On the one hand, the Dutch, Polish and Romanian language versions of that provision suggest a reduction in the costs associated with the remaining contract period (‘<span class="italic">een verlaging van de totale kredietkosten, bestaande uit de interesten en de kosten gedurende de resterende duur van de overeenkomst</span>’, ‘<span class="italic">obniżki całkowitego kosztu kredytu, na którą składają się odsetki i koszty przypadające na pozostały okres</span>
<span class="italic">obowiązywania umowy</span>’ and ‘<span class="italic">o reducere</span>
<span class="italic">a costului total al creditului, care constă în dobânda și în costurile aferente duratei restante a contractului</span>’). On the other hand, the German and English language versions of that provision are characterised by a certain ambiguity and suggest that the costs associated with that period are to serve as an indication for the calculation of the reduction (‘<span class="italic">das Recht auf Ermäßigung der Gesamtkosten des Kredits, die sich nach den Zinsen und den Kosten für die verbleibende Laufzeit des Vertrags richtet</span>’ and ‘<span class="italic">reduction consisting of the interest and the costs for the remaining duration of the contract</span>’). The Italian language version of that provision refers, like the French language version, to interest and costs ‘owed’ (‘<span class="italic">dovuti</span>’) for the remaining duration of the contract. Lastly, the Spanish language version of Article 16(1) of Directive 2008/48 requires a reduction that includes the costs corresponding to the remaining duration of the contract (‘<span class="italic">una reducción del coste total del crédito, que comprende los intereses y costes correspondientes a la duración del contrato que quede por transcurrir</span>’).</p>
