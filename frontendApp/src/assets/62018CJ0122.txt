A decisive shift to a culture of prompt payment, including one in which the exclusion of the right to charge interest should always be considered to be a grossly unfair contractual term or practice, is necessary to reverse this trend and to discourage late payment. Such a shift should also include the introduction of specific provisions on payment periods and on the compensation of creditors for the costs incurred, and, inter alia, that the exclusion of the right to compensation for recovery costs should be presumed to be grossly unfair.</p>

<p class="normal">As a general rule, public authorities benefit from more secure, predictable and continuous revenue streams than undertakings. In addition, many public authorities can obtain financing at more attractive conditions than undertakings. At the same time, public authorities depend less than undertakings on building stable commercial relationships for the achievement of their aims. Long payment periods and late payment by public authorities for goods and services lead to unjustified costs for undertakings. It is therefore appropriate to introduce specific rules as regards commercial transactions for the supply of goods or services by undertakings to public authorities, which should provide in particular for payment periods normally not exceeding 30 calendar days, unless otherwise expressly agreed in the contract and provided it is objectively justified in the light of the particular nature or features of the contract, and in any event not exceeding 60 calendar days.</p>

Indeed, given that that first indicator has the ‘standard’ 30-day period as point of reference in the analysis of the magnitude of late payments by public authorities, the Commission disregarded the fact that the 60-day period for payment provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 2011/7 applies not only to transactions carried out by those public entities providing healthcare, but also to those carried out by any public authority which carries out economic activities of an industrial and commercial nature and which is subject to Directive 2006/111. Second, the Commission made a misleading temporal comparison of the data by not taking into account the dynamic of making payments. That institution’s analysis therefore crystallised when the last bimonthly report was sent, without payments made subsequently being taken into account.</p>

In the present case, however, the data provided to the Commission demonstrate, on the one hand, a considerable and continuous reduction in late payments of the commercial debts of the public authorities and, on the other hand, regarding more specifically the public authorities operating within the national health service, a modest delay, exceeding by only a few days the period for payment prescribed in Article 4(4) of the same directive.</p>

In those circumstances, so as to ensure observance of EU law, Member States can intervene only indirectly, by correctly transposing the provisions with which these public authorities must comply and by imposing sanctions in the event of non-compliance with those provisions. In prescribing periods for payment not exceeding those prescribed in Directive 2011/7 and interest for late payment and compensation for recovery costs incurred, however, the Italian Republic has met the obligations imposed by that directive.</p>

If it were accepted, as the Commission maintains, however, that actual delays in payment by public authorities constitute an infringement of Directive 2011/7 attributable to the Member State concerned, then the Court necessarily found such a regulatory mechanism not to be in conformity with EU law, in so far as it allowed the systematic late payment of the commercial debts of public authorities. The Italian Republic concludes, first, that the right effectively guaranteed to creditors by Directive 2011/7 concerns only the late payment interest it imposes and, second, that the objective of that directive, which is combating late payment, ‘is pursued only indirectly’.</p>
