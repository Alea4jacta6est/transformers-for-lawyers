<p class="normal">The preamble to Ley 15/2012, de medidas fiscales para la sostenibilidad energética (Law 15/2012 on fiscal measures for sustainable energy), of 27 December 2012 (BOE No 312, of 28 December 2012, p. 88081 ‘the Energy Tax Law’), states:</p>
<p class="normal">‘The objective of [this Law] is to adapt our tax system to more efficient and environmentally friendly use and sustainable development, values that inspire this tax reform, and as such in line with the basic principles that govern the fiscal, energy and, of course, environmental policy of the European Union</p>
<p class="normal">…</p>
<p class="normal">… Thus, one of the axes of this tax reform is to internalise the environmental costs resulting from electricity production …</p>
<p class="normal">This Law must serve as a stimulus to improve our levels of energy efficiency while at the same time ensuring better management of natural resources and continuing to enhance the new model of sustainable development, both from an economic and social point of view, as well as from an environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="normal">The present reform also contributes to integrating environmental policies into our tax system …</p>
<p class="normal">To this end, this Law regulates three new taxes: …; a tax on the use of inland waters for the production of electricity is introduced. …</p>
<p class="normal">Lastly, Title IV of this Law modifies the consolidated text of the Water Law approved by Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2001 de 20 de julio (Royal Legislative Decree 1 of 20 July 2001 (‘the Water Law’)).</p>
<p class="normal">In particular, this Title regulates the economic and financial regime for the use of the public water resources. Thus, it provides that the competent public authorities, by virtue of the principle of cost recovery and taking into account long-term economic projections, are to establish the appropriate mechanisms to pass on the costs of services related to water management, including environmental and resource costs, to the different end users.</p>
<p class="normal">Articles 112 and 114 [of the Water Law] provide for four different water-related taxes: the tax for the use of assets comprising public water resources; the discharge tax, which taxes discharges into public water resources; the regulation tax, which taxes the private advantage obtained following [regulation] works [carried out by the State]; and water use taxes, which tax the private advantages obtained following work carried out by the State other than regulation work.</p>
<p class="normal">…</p>
<p class="normal">At present, the general quality of Spanish inland waters makes their protection necessary in order to safeguard one of the natural resources necessary for society. In that regard, policies for the protection of public water must be enhanced. To that end, it is necessary to obtain resources that must be provided by those who obtain a benefit from the private use of water or its use specifically for the production of electricity.</p>
<p class="normal">The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to apply a new tax to the public assets described in Article 2(a) of the [Water Law], that is to say, to the use or development of inland waters for the production of electricity.’</p>

<p class="normal">2.   The tax will become due on the initial granting and annual maintenance of the hydroelectric concession and will be payable in the corresponding amount and within the periods indicated in the conditions of the concession or authorisation.</p>
<p class="normal">3.   Those liable to pay the tax shall be the concession-holders or, as the case may be, those who are subrogated to them.</p>

<p class="normal">7.   The tax shall by reduced by 90% for hydroelectric installations with a capacity of 50 MW or less and for electricity-generating installations with hydro pump technology and a capacity of more than 50 MW, and in the manner to be determined by regulation for those productions or installations which are to be incentivised on general energy policy grounds.</p>
<p class="normal">8.   The management and collection of the tax shall be the responsibility of the competent Basin Authority or of the State Tax Authority, by virtue of an agreement with the latter.</p>
<p class="normal">In the event that the agreement is entered into with the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria [State Tax Administration Agency], the latter shall receive from the Basin Authority the relevant data and registers facilitating its administration, and shall periodically inform that authority in the manner to be determined by regulation. To that effect, the Comisión Nacional de Energía [National Energy Commission, Spain] and the Operador del Sistema eléctrico [Electricity System Operator, Spain] shall be required to provide the Basin Authority or the State Tax Authority with all the data and reports necessary under Article 94 of Ley 58/2003, de 17 de diciembre [Law No 58 of 17 December 2003].</p>

<p class="normal">According to the referring court, first, the taxable amount depends on the value of the energy produced, which is calculated on the basis of the total remuneration obtained for the energy injected into the electricity grid. The rate for that tax in force at the material time was 22%, whereas Article 112 bis of the consolidated text of the Water Law provided for a rate of only 5% for the occupation, use and exploitation of natural watercourses, whether continuous or discontinuous streams, and the beds of lakes and lagoons and surface reservoirs in public watercourses requiring concession or administrative authorisation. Secondly, only 2% of the amount of the tax collected is allocated to the activities of the organismo de cuenca (public body responsible for managing the waters in river basins districts, Spain), the remaining 98% being paid to the public exchequer and thus constituting additional revenue for the electricity system. The referring court states that the amount of that tax ought to have been allocated in full to the protection and improvement of public water resources and that Royal Decree 198/2015 sought to correct that inconsistency by specifying that the General State budgets allocated an amount at least equal to 98% of the revenues achieved by that tax to measures to protect and improve public water resources. The referring court states, however, that such allocation was not respected in the general State budget for 2016, which allocated the revenues generated by that tax to the deficit of the electricity system.</p>

<p class="normal">As regards the substantive response to the admissible parts of the third questions raised in all the joined cases, characterisation of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, that all the following conditions be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Secondly, that intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States. Thirdly, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourthly, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, in particular, judgment of 29 July 2019, Azienda Napoletana Mobilità, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A633&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑659/17</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A633&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=null" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2019:633</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A633&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=null&amp;anchor=#point20" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">20</a>).</p>
