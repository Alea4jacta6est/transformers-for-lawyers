<p class="normal">That being so, as the Italian Government argued, in essence, if the EU legislature had intended that the reduced rate of excise duty on commercial gas oil should apply to all activities of the carriage of passengers, without distinction between regular and occasional carriage, it would have used the expression ‘carriage of passengers’ in Article 7(3)(b) of Directive 2003/96. The use of the expression ‘regular or occasional carriage of passengers’ therefore suggests that regular carriage of passengers and occasional carriage of passengers, linked by the conjunction ‘or’, must not necessarily be cumulatively subject to the reduced rate of excise duty, but may also be subject to it alternatively.</p>
