<p class="coj-normal">According to the Hungarian Government, the General Court failed to have regard to the fact that a suspension injunction must be consistent with the FEU Treaty and the general principles of EU law. It is true that the General Court stated in paragraph 86 of the judgment under appeal that ‘the review by the EU judicature is not limited only to the conditions provided for in Article 11(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 and may extend, inter alia, to the compatibility of the suspension [injunction] with the [FEU Treaty] and the general principles of law’. Nevertheless, in paragraphs 70 and 71 of that judgment, the General Court restricted the conditions for adopting a suspension injunction to the two conditions imposed in Article 11(1) of Regulation No 659/1999. Likewise, in paragraph 87 of the judgment it limited its examination to that article alone. The General Court committed the same error of law in paragraphs 95 and 134 of the judgment under appeal, in holding that, when the Commission orders a measure to be suspended pursuant to Article 11(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, it is not required to satisfy itself that the injunction is necessary and proportionate.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">The Commission submits that there is no inconsistency between, on the one hand, paragraphs 71 and 95 of the judgment under appeal and, on the other, paragraphs 86 and 98 of that judgment. Paragraphs 86 and 98 must be interpreted in the light of paragraphs 130 and 134 of the judgment, according to which the appropriateness of adopting a suspension injunction is sufficiently justified by the existence of a proven infringement of Article 108(3) TFEU and therefore further reasons do not need to be stated. The prohibition laid down in Article 108(3) TFEU applies even before the Commission adopts a decision to initiate a formal investigation procedure. Once a Member State puts an aid measure into effect without having notified the Commission of it, there is an infringement of Article 108(3) TFEU. Classification of the national measure at issue as unlawful State aid is the substantive condition laid down in Article 11(1) of Regulation No 659/1999. That is why the Commission takes the view that it was inconsistent for the General Court to hold in paragraphs 135 to 137 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission has to set out in the decision imposing the suspension injunction the grounds for its view that the Member State is unlikely to observe that prohibition.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">‘70 The conditions for the adoption of such an [injunction], laid down in Article 11(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, are restricted to a substantive condition, namely the classification by the Commission, at that stage of the procedure, of the national measure concerned as unlawful State aid, and a procedural condition, namely giving the Member State concerned the possibility to submit its comments.</p>

The wording of that article, which reflects the legal arrangements covered by the settled case-law cited in paragraph 30 above, was not altered by the amendments introduced in Regulation No 659/1999 and was reproduced, in its original form, in the new Regulation 2015/1589.’</p>

It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 296 TFEU must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (judgment of 10 March 2016, HeidelbergCement v Commission, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A149&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑247/14 P</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A149" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2016:149</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A149" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">16</a> and the case-law cited).</p>

Particular grounds must therefore lead the institution to adopt such a decision. As has been recalled in the preceding paragraph, by virtue of the obligation to state reasons for acts of the institutions, the grounds of any decision must be made known to its addressee in order to enable him or her to assess their merits and to exercise, where appropriate, the right to bring proceedings in an informed manner. Communication of the grounds is also required in order to enable the EU judicature to review, as it does for any act, the legality of the suspension injunction in the light of the principle of proportionality and to verify that the Commission has not made unjustified use of the power conferred on it by Article 11(1) of Regulation No 659/1999.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Where, as in this instance, the suspension injunction is adopted at the same time as the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, the grounds that prompt the Commission to issue it necessarily relate to foreseeing that the Member State concerned will not suspend implementation of the measure at issue despite initiation of the investigation procedure. As has been stated in paragraph 34 of the present judgment, the only additional effect of the suspension injunction compared with the effects of initiation of the formal investigation procedure is to enable the Commission, if the Member State concerned does not comply with its obligation to suspend implementation of the measure under investigation, to bring an action for failure to fulfil obligations directly before the Court, pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation No 659/1999. Consequently, if the Commission were not required, where the suspension injunction is adopted at the same time as the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, to indicate the reasons for which it considers that the Member State will not comply with the suspension obligation and is consequently already envisaging bringing an action before the Court, it would be spared the need to state reasons for that suspension injunction, in breach of the obligation to state reasons.</p>

However, as the Advocate General has noted in point 93 of her Opinion, a Member State is perfectly entitled to defend itself by asserting that the measure in question does not constitute aid.

It further submits that the grounds in paragraphs 135 to 137 of the judgment under appeal are contrary to those set out in paragraphs 70, 71, 130 and 134 of that judgment. The Commission also acknowledged, in its observations on the Republic of Poland’s statement in intervention, that the decisions at issue did not provide specific explanations of the reasons why it had taken the view that Hungary was not planning to suspend grant of the aid at issue.
