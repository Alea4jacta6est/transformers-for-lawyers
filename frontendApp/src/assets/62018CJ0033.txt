According to that court, that guide seems to indicate that that provision is applicable on condition that, on 1 May 2010, which is the date on which Regulation No 1408/71 was repealed and Regulation No 883/2004 became applicable, the person concerned was in fact subject to the legislation of the competent Member State under Regulation No 1408/71.

The answer to those questions has a direct effect on the determination of the number of years for which the Belgian authorities are entitled to claim payment of contributions from Mr V.</p>
