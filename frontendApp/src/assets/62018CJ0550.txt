Directive 2015/849 marks a significant evolution in the European Union’s rules on anti-money laundering compared to the provisions of Directive 2005/60, since, in particular, Directive 2015/849 broadens the scope of application of the anti-money laundering rules, by extending in several respects the concept of the ‘obliged entities’ who are subject to those rules. Directive 2015/849 expressly introduces the inclusion of tax crimes in the list of predicate offences of money laundering and extends the definition of politically exposed persons to include domestic persons. That directive emerges from, and is a reflection of, an updated policy environment regarding money laundering. Furthermore, during the pre-litigation procedure, Ireland never notified any of the national measures transposing Directive 2005/60 in the framework of the transposition of Directive 2015/849, nor did it provide a correlation table that would demonstrate the relevance of such national provisions and explain the relationship between those individual national provisions and the provisions of Directive 2015/849.</p>

Secondly, the provisions of a directive should be implemented with undeniable binding force and with the specificity, precision and clarity required, in order to satisfy the requirement of legal certainty which requires that where the directive is intended to create rights for individuals, the beneficiaries should be able to know the fullness of their rights. In the present case, on the expiry of the period prescribed in the reasoned opinion of 8 March 2018, those requirements had not been met.</p>

The first three Money Laundering Directives were already transposed by extant national legislation, in particular the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 (‘the 2010 Act’). The 2010 Act already comprised many of the fundamental requirements of Directive 2015/849, with the result that, even in the absence of legislative amendments being introduced by the 2018 Act, the 2010 Act already ran to 122 sections, 85 of which pertained to obliged entities and their obligations.

Where the Commission finds that there are gaps in the transposition of a directive into national law, this does not in any way mean that it has conducted a review of the conformity of existing provisions of national law with that directive. That is all the more true where, as in the present case, the defaulting Member State itself accepts that the transposition of the directive at issue into its national law is still lacking in part. In addition, having regard to the objective of Article 260(3) TFEU, as specified by the Court in its judgment of 8 July 2019, Commission v Belgium (Article 260(3) TFEU — High-speed networks) (<a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑543/17</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2019:573</a>), the application of that provision is not limited to cases of a complete absence of transposition.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">The Commission also rejects the argument that, in the present case, it acted in a disproportionate manner in proposing financial penalties and that it failed to meet the requirements of the duty of sincere cooperation under Article 4(3) TEU. In that regard, it emphasises that it has never denied that Ireland had acted in good faith and cooperated sincerely. In addition, there is no need to examine the applicability of Article 260(3) TFEU in the light of the <span class="coj-italic">bona fides</span> of the Member State concerned, since it is not in dispute that Ireland was late in adopting the main instrument of national law chosen by it to give effect to most of the provisions of Directive 2015/849, that is the 2018 Act. That approach of the Commission is all the more apposite, since the very purpose of Article 260(3) TFEU is to induce Member States to transpose in a timely fashion all the provisions of a directive. There is no need to fear that Member States will compromise the quality of transposition in favour of timeliness of transposition, since the EU legislature had in mind the periods that would be required for satisfactory quality to be ensured in transposition, and those considerations are already embedded in the choice of transposition date laid down by directives. Moreover, the Court has held that if the period allowed for the implementation of a directive proves to be too short, the only means of action compatible with EU law available to the Member State concerned consists in taking the appropriate initiatives to obtain the necessary extension of the period by the competent institution.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">The Commission submits, lastly, that its decision systematically to request the Court to impose a financial penalty pursuant to Article 260(3) TFEU cannot be understood as a failure on its part to exercise its discretion. Indeed, in point 16 of the 2011 communication, the Commission expressly took account of the fact that that provision confers wide discretionary powers on it, along the lines of the power to decide whether to bring infringement proceedings under Article 258 TFEU. Consequently, the policy decision to make use of the instrument provided for by Article 260(3) TFEU as a matter of principle in all cases of failure to fulfil an obligation covered by that provision was taken in the exercise of the Commission’s discretionary power. Although the Commission does not exclude that particular cases might arise in which a request for penalties under that provision would appear to it to be inappropriate, it makes clear that that is not the case here.</p>

The Commission’s argument relating to the period after 29 November 2018 is based on a qualitative analysis of the transposition of that directive, which proves that it is difficult to distinguish between ‘complete transposition’ and ‘incorrect transposition’ of a directive. In such a case, a Member State would be prevented from ascertaining whether or not a given failure to fulfil obligations falls within the scope of Article 260(3) TFEU and, if so, the period during which such a failure persisted. Even assuming that, in the present case, there had still been gaps in the transposition of Directive 2015/849 after 26 November 2018, which Ireland disputes, those gaps would be attributable to misinterpretation by Ireland of its obligations, inadvertence or gaps in population of the correlation table.

<p class="coj-normal">Ireland also contends that whether Article 260(3) TFEU is applicable must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the <span class="coj-italic">bone fides</span> of the Member State concerned. Since the power conferred upon the Commission by Article 260(3) TFEU is discretionary in nature, it must be concluded that the Commission’s blanket policy, as set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘EU law: Better results through better application’ (<a href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:C:2017:018:TOC" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';">OJ 2017 C 18 p. 10</a>), consisting in systematically requesting the imposition of lump sums and penalty payments, is not consistent with the objective of that provision. In addition, that policy does not accommodate good faith efforts by Member States. In the present case, the Commission was informed of the progress in transposing Directive 2015/849 and of the timetable established for adopting the measures transposing it. In such circumstances, the imposition of a lump sum payment is not likely to achieve a deterrent effect such as to safeguard ‘the general interests pursued by Union legislation’ referred to by the Commission, but might, on the contrary, serve to motivate Member States to compromise the quality of transposition in favour of timeliness of transposition. Accordingly, the Commission approach infringes the principle of proportionality set out in Article 5(4) TEU. Furthermore, that approach does not sit well with the Commission’s duty of sincere cooperation under Article 4(3) TEU. Its decision to request systematically the payment of a lump sum without stating reasons for that request on a case-by-case basis is indeed contrary to the case-law of the Court according to which the imposition of a lump sum must not be automatic and must be decided according to the circumstances of the case. In the present case, the Commission’s objective is to make an example of Ireland and to prompt the other Member States, in future, to comply with the transposition periods prescribed in directives. That is unfair and unlawful. The Commission’s conduct is based, moreover, on the assumption that Member States are seeking to delay transposition of directives, which is tantamount in fact to assuming bad faith on their part. Such an assumption runs counter to the duty of sincere cooperation under Article 4(3) TEU.</p>

As is apparent from the Court’s case-law in that area, specific reasons for such a decision must be provided in relation to the particular circumstances of each case. The Commission cannot simply make use, as a matter of principle, of the instrument laid down in Article 260(3) TFEU, without infringing that provision. In addition, a detailed analysis of each case by the Commission is required since those elements are necessary in order to determine the nature of the financial penalty which should be imposed to prompt the Member State concerned to put an end to the failure to fulfil obligations at issue and in order to establish an amount which is appropriate to the circumstances of the case, as required by that case-law.</p>

That minimum lump sum is not, however, to be applied in the present case, since it is lower than the amount which results from calculating the lump sum in accordance with those communications. In order to determine the daily amount forming the basis of that calculation, the standard flat-rate amount of EUR 230 must be multiplied by the coefficient for seriousness and by the ‘n’ factor of 2.92 for Ireland. The coefficient for seriousness decreased as Ireland notified additional transposition measures. Consequently, for the period from 27 June 2017 to 28 November 2018, the coefficient for seriousness is 7 on a scale of 1 to 20, for the period from 29 November 2018 to 26 March 2019, the coefficient for seriousness is 2, and for the period from 27 March to 2 December 2019, the coefficient for seriousness is 1. Adding together the three amounts corresponding to those periods, namely EUR 2 439 922.80, EUR 158 497.60 and EUR 168 571.60, the Commission requests the imposition of a total lump sum of EUR 2766992.</p>

In addition, in circumstances where the failure to fulfil obligations has come to an end by the time of the Court’s judgment in the case concerning that failure to fulfil obligations, the Court may find that no lump sum payment is necessary. Indeed, no lump sum payment should be imposed in the present case. As to the remainder, there is no reason to apply the calculation method for financial penalties imposed under Article 260(2) TFEU to those imposed under Article 260(3) TFEU, since the seriousness of the failures to fulfil obligations to be penalised is not the same.</p>

In addition, to calculate the lump sum by reference to a daily amount, thereby exceeding the minimum lump sum proposed by the Commission, would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty. As regards the date on which the failure to fulfil obligations came to an end, Ireland notes that, in its view, this was 29 November 2018, not 3 December 2019 as the Commission argues. As at 29 November 2018, all the provisions of Directive 2015/849 which had to be transposed had been fully transposed into national law. If, notwithstanding the fact that the failure to fulfil obligations at issue came to an end on the day on which the Court examined the facts, the Court nonetheless decided to impose a lump sum on Ireland, that financial penalty should be the minimum.</p>

The coefficient for seriousness should, therefore, be reduced in the present case to 1. Among those mitigating factors, Ireland notes in particular that the 2018 Act entered into force during the course of the proceedings, that transposition by primary legislation is connected to the strength of enforcement measures set out in extant legislation, that Ireland prioritised progress of the Bill through the Houses of Parliament, that it kept the Commission informed of legislative progress of the Bill and that it has abided by the indicative timetable notified to the Commission prior to the commencement of legal proceedings.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">As regards, in the first place, the argument that it would be disproportionate to impose a lump sum since, in the course of the proceedings, Ireland put an end to the infringement at issue, it must be borne in mind, first, that the failure of a Member State to fulfil its obligation to notify measures transposing a directive, whether by providing no information at all, partial information or by providing insufficiently clear and precise information, may of itself justify recourse to the procedure under Article 258 TFEU in order to establish the failure to fulfil the obligation (judgment of 8 July 2019, Commission v Belgium (Article 260(3) TFEU — High-speed networks), <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑543/17</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2019:573</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">51</a>). Secondly, the objective pursued by the introduction of the system set out in Article 260(3) TFEU is not only to induce Member States to put an end as soon as possible to a breach of obligations which, in the absence of such a measure, would tend to persist, but also to simplify and speed up the procedure for imposing financial penalties for failures to comply with the obligation to notify a national measure transposing a directive adopted through a legislative procedure, it being specified that, prior to the introduction of such a system, it might be years before a financial penalty was imposed on Member States which had failed to comply in a timely manner with an earlier judgment of the Court and failed to respect their obligations to transpose a directive (judgment of 8 July 2019, Commission v Belgium (Article 260(3) TFEU — High-speed networks), <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑543/17</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2019:573</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2019%3A573" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">52</a>).</p>

Likewise, it is irrelevant that the failure of a Member State to fulfil its obligations is the result of technical difficulties encountered by it (see, in particular, judgment of 7 May 2002, Commission v Netherlands, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2002%3A282&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑364/00</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2002%3A282" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2002:282</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2002%3A282" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">10</a> and the case-law cited).

First, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that not only were the national provisions which, in Ireland’s view, transposed Article 61(3) and Article 62(2) of that directive, only notified with the rejoinder of 4 March 2019, but, moreover, they contain no reference to that directive. Secondly, as the Advocate General observed in point 72 of his Opinion, national measures transposing the provisions of Article 47(2) of Directive 2015/849 did not enter into force until 3 December 2019. The same applies to the provisions of Article 48(5) to (8) of that directive, in respect of which Ireland accepts that it had not adopted any transposition measure before the measures which entered into force on 3 December 2019, on the ground that those provisions were, in its view, ancillary and incidental. Such an assessment by a Member State is manifestly insufficient to relieve it of its obligation to adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with a directive or its obligation to notify to the Commission the measures transposing that directive.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Contrary to what Ireland contends, this approach is not likely to compromise the principle of legal certainty, since, in a situation such as that at issue in the present case, the Member State in question cannot validly maintain that it was unaware of having failed to fulfil, as from the date of transposition laid down in the directive in question, its obligations under that directive. In addition, the protection of the rights of defence of the Member State in question guaranteed by the pre-litigation procedure cannot result in that Member State being protected against all financial consequences stemming from that failure to fulfil obligations for the period preceding the deadline set in the reasoned opinion.</p>

Ireland cannot, therefore, validly claim that it was unaware that the failure to fulfil obligations at issue could give rise to an action under Article 260(3) TFEU.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In the present case, it is not in dispute that, as at the date of transposition laid down in Article 67 of Directive 2015/849, namely 26 June 2017, Ireland had not adopted the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to ensure that that directive was transposed and had not, therefore, notified to the Commission the measures transposing it. It follows that the failure to fulfil obligations at issue, which did not come to an end until 3 December 2019, and thus one week before the hearing, persisted for almost two and a half years.</p>
