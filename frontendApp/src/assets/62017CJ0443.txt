<p class="normal">At the outset, it should be noted that, as is clear from the order for reference, the dispute in the main proceedings concerns an application for an SPC, the subject of which is a new formulation of an old active ingredient, paclitaxel, in the form of nanoparticles coated with albumin which acts as a carrier for paclitaxel. According to the information provided by the referring court, that new formulation, called ‘nab-paclitaxel’, allows the active ingredient to exercise its therapeutic effects with an increased efficacy. It is marketed as a medicinal product under the mark ‘Abraxane’. That medicinal product was subject to an MA which is the first MA coming within the scope of the basic patent covering that new formulation. The referring court also states that paclitaxel had already, prior to the grant of the MA in respect of Abraxane, been marketed under other MAs.</p>
