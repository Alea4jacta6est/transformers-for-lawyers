Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, in the event that the wholesale operator of liquefied petroleum gas with the home delivery obligation for containers with a net weight equal to, or greater than, 8 kg and less than 20 kg does not have containers whose tare weight is greater than 9 kg, the home delivery obligation at the maximum price referred to in paragraph 3 shall be extended to containers with a tare weight of less than 9 kg, in the corresponding territory.</p>

The list of operators with the delivery obligation is to be determined by resolution of the General Director of Energy Policy and Mines every 3 years. According to the thirty-third additional provision of Law 34/1998, the government is to review the conditions for exercising that obligation ‘when the evolution of the market and the business structure of the sector require it and, in any case, every 5 years’.</p>

<p class="normal">The referring court notes, furthermore, that before the adoption of Royal Decree-Law 8/2014, other provisions of Law 34/1998 already provided for the possibility of setting a maximum sale price of bottled LPG and a home delivery obligation. According to that court, those measures have been continually implemented and extended since 1998, in spite of the fact that the relevant legislation expressly makes those measures transitional. The extension of those measures for a period of that length could impede the entry of new operators into the relevant market. Those new operators would be in a situation in which the operator holding the largest share of the market in a given territory offers bottled LPG at a maximum price set by the Administration, which also includes home delivery.</p>

<p class="normal">The referring court takes the view that imposing a maximum price including home delivery may constitute a barrier to new operators entering into the market. It is true that, if new operators use lighter bottles which are not subject to the regulated price, they could set the prices freely. However, in practice, they could not deviate from those prices unless they were to be at risk of demand not being sufficient to justify the investments to be made. There are therefore reasons for believing that those measures, in reality, freeze the market, contrary to free competition.</p>

The referring court considers that those measures could thus obstruct the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the FEU Treaty. It takes the view, however, that those measures pursue an objective in the general economic interest, namely the supply of energy at a reasonable price to vulnerable consumers. It is in that context that it is asking whether, in the light of their restrictive effects on the internal market and in the light of the objective pursued, the measures at issue in the main proceedings are proportionate.</p>

It is apparent from the observations that the Spanish Government has submitted to the Court that the Spanish market for bottled LPG is in recession due to the expansion of the natural gas market. According to the Spanish Government, the resulting reduction in sales increases the costs of the operators present in that market and makes it more difficult for new competitors who could exert pressure on prices to establish themselves.

<p class="normal">Moreover, it is common ground that domestic consumers benefit from the measures at issue in the main proceedings regardless of whether they are socially vulnerable or live in areas that are remote or far from LPG distribution points. Although that fact may, in principle, be an indication that those measures go beyond what is necessary in order to attain their objective, the fact remains that the principle of proportionality does not necessarily prevent the measures at issue from being applied to all domestic consumers (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 April 2010, Federutility and Others, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A205&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑265/08</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A205&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2010:205</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A205&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point40" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">40</a>). The referring court must examine, in that context, the possibility and the appropriateness of adopting measures aimed more at vulnerable consumers. In that regard, the arguments of the applicants in the main proceedings and of the Spanish Government, relating to the feasibility of adopting alternative measures and relating to the possible economic effects of such measures, are relevant.</p>
