That is why Herst needed to use an intermediary which operates such a warehouse, so that the intermediary could acquire the fuel in question in order to pay the excise duty and ensure that it was released for free circulation in the Czech Republic. The Tax Directorate submits that the involvement of a number of economic operators in the chain is evidence of VAT evasion.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">The referring court considers, in essence, that there is doubt as to whether the fact that goods are transported under an excise duty suspension arrangement — in accordance with Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC (<a href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2009:009:TOC" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';">OJ 2009 L 9, p. 12</a>) — affects the conditions governing the transfer of the right to dispose of the goods as owner, provided for by the VAT Directive. In that regard, the referring court points out that, where there is doubt as to the interpretation of a provision of national tax law in a dispute between the authorities and an individual, the case-law of the Ústavní soud České republiky (Constitutional Court, Czech Republic) has identified a constitutional principle under national law pursuant to which any doubt should be resolved in favour of the individual (the principle of ‘<span class="coj-italic">in dubio mitius</span>’). In the present case, the referring court considers that, at the time of the facts in the main proceedings, the decisive legislation for the purposes of resolving the dispute before it cannot be described as clear, either at the level of national law or EU law, so that it is uncertain whether, if the interpretation adopted by the Court in this judgment is unfavourable to the taxpayer, the referring court must comply with it, regardless of the constitutional principle under national law. The referring court also wonders whether, in the light of that principle, the effects of the Court’s judgment should not be limited to legal situations which arise after it has been delivered.</p>
