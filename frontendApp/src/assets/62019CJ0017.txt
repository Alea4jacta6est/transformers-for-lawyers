That court held that Elco’s activity in France had been performed in a habitual, stable and continuous manner, which meant that it was not entitled to rely on the legislation on posting of workers. The court found, in that regard, that the vast majority of the workers in question had been engaged by Elco solely with a view to being posted to France a few days before they were posted, most of them not having worked for that company or having worked for it only for a short time, that Elco’s activity in Romania had become ancillary to its activity in France, that the administrative management of the workers concerned was not carried out in Romania and that certain postings had lasted for more than 24 months.</p>

In that regard, that court found, first, that Bouygues and Welbond had, through the Cypriot subsidiary of Atlanco and an office of that subsidiary in Poland, recruited Polish temporary workers by having them sign a contract drawn up in Greek, with a view to supplying them to French companies, through the intermediary of two employees of that subsidiary based in Dublin (Ireland) and working in France. Second, that court noted that that subsidiary was not registered in the commercial and companies register in France and that it had no business activities in either Cyprus or Poland. Finally, that court established that, although Bouygues and Welbond had indeed asked Atlanco for the documents relating to the temporary Polish workers on the Flamanville site, in particular the E 101 and A 1 Certificates, they had continued to employ those workers without all those documents being sent to them.</p>

By providing the competent authorities with all relevant information concerning the future contractual relationship between the employer and the worker concerned, that declaration makes it possible, inter alia, to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of employment laid down by the national rules in the field of employment law where a worker is, as in the case in the main proceedings, not posted within the meaning of those rules, but employed in France.
