Next, where that examination does not enable the fixed establishment of that customer of the service to be identified, it is necessary to pay particular attention to whether the contract, the order form and the VAT identification number attributed by the Member State of the customer and communicated to him by the customer identify the fixed establishment as the customer of the service and whether the fixed establishment is the entity paying for the service.
