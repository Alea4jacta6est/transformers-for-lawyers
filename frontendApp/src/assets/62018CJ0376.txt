The referring court states that regulated entities include both entities with tax residence in Slovakia (‘domestic regulated entities’) and regulated entities with tax residence abroad (‘foreign regulated entities’), that second category including regulated entities established abroad which are authorised on the basis of an authorisation to carry on an activity issued to those entities in their State of origin (‘passport’ authorisation). While the former are subject to the special levy on revenue generated from their activities both in Slovakia and abroad, the latter are subject to that levy only with respect to revenue generated from their activities in that Member State. A regulated entity is not, however, subject to the special levy for each given accounting period unless its economic result has reached, for the accounting period in question, an amount of at least EUR 3000000.</p>

<p class="normal">The referring court raises the question, in the first place, whether the special levy disregards the objective pursued by Directive 2009/72, in that it impedes the development of a fully competitive electricity market. According to the referring court, first, that levy has an impact on the freedom of the regulated entities concerned to set a fully competitive price for the supply of electricity in foreign markets and thus affects competition in those markets. Secondly, that levy taxes not only the revenue of the regulated entities concerned which is generated from the regulated activity in respect of which those entities have been issued with an authorisation but also the revenue that those entities generate from other activities. Consequently, that levy is capable of discouraging new competitors from entering the Slovak and foreign electricity supply markets. Thirdly, the special levy could have an impact on the competitiveness of domestic regulated entities in foreign markets, since, unlike foreign regulated entities, they are subject to that levy with respect to revenue from activities they perform in those markets. Finally, the referring court states that the only means by which a regulated entity could avoid that levy is to request that its authorisation be revoked.</p>

Further, if, according to that court, it can be accepted that that levy pursues an objective of social and economic cohesion, doubts persist as regards the proportionality of that levy within the meaning of that directive, since, first, that levy taxes the revenue of domestic regulated entities that is generated from their activities, including those abroad, secondly, it applies to regulated entities on the sole ground that they hold an authorisation and, thirdly, Law No 235/2012 establishing the special levy precludes the entity concerned from passing on the amount of that levy to the final customer.</p>

In that regard, that court states that it is impossible to determine whether the special levy allows the objective pursued by Law No 235/2012 to be attained and whether its indefinite application is necessary to that end. Furthermore, that court raises the question whether that law disregards the principle of non-discrimination, in so far as domestic regulated entities are taxed on a broader base as compared with foreign regulated entities.</p>

In that regard, that institution states that the special levy concerns regulated entities not only in the energy sector but in other sectors, as well. Consequently, that levy does not apply to the supply of electricity as such but taxes the comprehensive income of the entity concerned.
