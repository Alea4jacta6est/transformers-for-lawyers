<p class="normal">In the present case, the Luxembourg Government submits that the introduction into Article 3(5)(b) of the Law of 24 July 2014 of a seven-year reference period for the calculation of the minimum period of employment of five years makes it possible, precisely, to take account of short breaks in the employment of the cross-border worker parents, since it covers situations in which the cross-border worker parent was not employed in Luxembourg for two years over a total period of seven years. However, the national legislature is entitled to take the view that, unlike minor breaks, longer breaks sever the connection of cross-border workers and their student children with Luxembourg and remove the interest of that Member State in granting aid to those students. In particular, an break in employment of almost five years, such as that admitted by Mr Aubriet senior, could legitimately be deemed to have such an effect.</p>

Mr Aubriet senior was a taxpayer in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and made contributions to the social security scheme of that State for more than 17 years during the 23 years preceding his son’s application for financial aid for higher education studies, namely from 1991 to 2014.</p>
