<p class="coj-normal">A choice had to be made in respect of the criteria to be applied when deciding which and how many applicants are to be relocated from Italy and from Greece, without prejudice to decisions at national level on asylum applications. A clear and workable system is envisaged based on a threshold of the average rate at Union level of decisions granting international protection in the procedures at first instance, as defined by Eurostat, out of the total number at Union level of decisions on applications for international protection taken at first instance, based on the latest available statistics. On the one hand, this threshold would have to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that all applicants in clear need of international protection would be in a position to fully and swiftly enjoy their protection rights in the Member State of relocation. On the other hand, it would have to prevent, to the maximum extent possible, applicants who are likely to receive a negative decision on their application from being relocated to another Member State, and therefore from prolonging unduly their stay in the Union. A threshold of 75%, based on the latest available updated Eurostat quarterly data for decisions at first instance, should be used in this Decision.</p>

The Member State of relocation may decide not to approve the relocation of an applicant only if there are reasonable grounds as referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">10.   The relocation procedure provided for in this Article shall be completed as swiftly as possible and not later than 2 months from the time of the indication given by the Member State of relocation as referred to in paragraph 2, unless the approval by the Member State of relocation referred to in paragraph 4 takes place less than 2 weeks before the expiry of that 2-month period. In such case, the time limit for completing the relocation procedure may be extended for a period not exceeding a further 2 weeks. In addition, the time limit may also be extended, for a further 4-week period, as appropriate, where Italy or Greece show objective practical obstacles that prevent the transfer from taking place.</p>

The excessively short deadlines for replying and the hurried nature of the pre-litigation procedure can be explained not by a real emergency, but by the fact that the Commission still wanted at all costs to be able to fix in the reasoned opinion the end of the period prescribed for the Member States in question to comply with their obligations such that it would expire before those decisions ceased to be applicable in September 2017, in order to prevent the defence that its actions were inadmissible from being raised against it.

That decision was motivated by the fact that, before initiating those proceedings and before the expiry of that period of application, that institution wished to give one last opportunity to the three Member States in question, which had either not yet relocated any applicant for international protection or not made any relocation commitments for over a year, to comply with their obligations under those decisions by making formal commitments and by relocating applicants for international protection, at the latest within one month.</p>

Such safeguarding of internal security was not ensured on account above all of the absence of adequate information on the persons concerned and of the impossibility of conducting interviews to ascertain that the applicants for international protection concerned do not pose a threat to national security or law and order in the Member State of relocation.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In this connection, according to settled case-law of the Court of Justice, although it is for the Member States to adopt appropriate measures to ensure law and order on their territory and their internal and external security, it does not follow that such measures fall entirely outside the scope of European Union law. As the Court has already held, the only articles in which the Treaty expressly provides for derogations applicable in situations which may affect law and order or public security are Articles 36, 45, 52, 65, 72, 346 and 347 TFEU, which deal with exceptional and clearly defined cases. It cannot be inferred that the Treaty contains an inherent general exception excluding all measures taken for reasons of law and order or public security from the scope of European Union law.

<p class="coj-normal">As a preliminary point, it should be recalled, as already stated in paragraph 31 of this judgment, that on 5 June 2017 the Czech Republic adopted Resolution No 439 by which that Member State decided to suspend the implementation of its obligations taken on at the meeting of the European Council on 25 and 26 June 2015, subsequently formalised at the meeting of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the European Council, of 20 July 2015 and implemented by Decision 2015/1523, as well as the implementation of its obligations under Decision 2015/1601 ‘in view of the significant deterioration of the security situation in the Union … and having regard to the obvious malfunctioning of the relocation system’. It is common ground that at no subsequent point during the respective periods of application of those decisions did the Czech Republic lift that suspension.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In the present case, in its defence in the infringement proceedings concerning it, the Czech Republic relies on considerations relating to the alleged malfunctioning or ineffectiveness of the relocation mechanism provided for in Decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601, as applied in practice, including the specific mechanism provided for in Article 5(4) and (7) of each of those decisions aimed at enabling Member States to protect their national security or public order in the context of the relocation procedure, as a justification for its decision not to implement its relocation obligations under Article 5(2) and Article 5(4) to (11) of each of those decisions.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Furthermore, the practical difficulties in the application of Decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601 referred to by the Czech Republic do not appear to be inherent in the relocation mechanism provided for in those decisions, nor indeed in the specific mechanism contained in Article 5(4) and (7) of each of those decisions, and must, in accordance with what has already been recalled in paragraph 164 above, be resolved, should they arise, in the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust between the authorities of the Member States that are beneficiaries of relocation and those of the Member States of relocation. That spirit of cooperation and mutual trust must prevail when the relocation procedure provided for in Article 5 of each of those decisions is implemented.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Thus, the alleged ineffectiveness or alleged malfunctioning of the relocation mechanism did not prevent other Member States from making, at regular intervals, relocation commitments and from actually relocating applicants for international protection throughout the respective periods of application of Decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601 and, even more markedly, towards the end of those periods, in response to the call made by the Commission in its monthly reports on relocation and resettlement to intensify the rhythm of relocations before the expiry of those periods.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In this connection, as already observed in paragraph 166 above, during the period of application of Decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601, some adjustments were made to the relocation procedure in order to address, inter alia, the practical problems mentioned by the Czech Republic. That is the case concerning, in particular, the option for Member States of relocation to perform additional security checks in Greece or Italy prior to the relocation of applicants for international protection and the opportunity, offered as of 1 December 2016, to request Europol’s assistance to carry out those additional security checks in Italy.</p>

Besides, it should be noted that certain types of aid were indeed imposed under those decisions or under other acts adopted at European Union level. In no circumstances could such aid replace the implementation of the obligations resulting from Decisions 2015/1523 and 2015/1601.</p>
