It held that the contract at issue in the main proceedings is a ‘contract for passenger transport services’ within the meaning of Paragraph 312(2)(5) of the Civil Code, which transposes Article 3(3)(k) of Directive 2011/83. The court stated that, under those provisions, that contract is partially excluded from the directive’s scope and, accordingly, the trader is not required to inform the consumer about the right of withdrawal. It observed that the provision of a transport service to a passenger involves the existence of a synallagmatic relationship with the price paid for that service, the reduction card entitling its holder to obtain the service concerned at a reduced price.</p>

Referring to the first paragraph of Article 57 TFEU, it takes the view that the directive, in the light of its wording and purpose, also covers services provided to the consumer that take the form of a commitment or a right, such as the service at issue in the main proceedings, which enables the consumer subsequently to acquire passenger tickets at a reduced price.</p>

Whilst the latter term relates only to carriage of passengers and goods performed by the carrier, the term ‘contracts for the provision of … transport … services’ can cover all contracts governing services in the field of transport, including those involving an activity which does not include, as such, the carriage of the customer or his goods, but which is aimed at enabling the customer to perform that carriage (see, to that effect, the judgment in <span class="coj-italic">easyCar</span>, paragraph 23).</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Second, as has been observed by all the interested parties which have submitted observations in the present proceedings, a contract whose object is to entitle the consumer to a price reduction when passenger transport contracts are subsequently concluded and a contract for the purchase of a passenger ticket are two contracts that are legally distinct from one another, so that the former cannot be regarded as a contract inextricably linked to the latter. The purchase of a card conferring upon its holder entitlement to price reductions when transport tickets are purchased does not necessarily entail the subsequent conclusion of a contract whose object is passenger transport itself.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Third, as the European Commission has observed, the existence of a right of withdrawal, pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2011/83, following the purchase of a card conferring entitlement to a price reduction when passenger tickets are subsequently purchased does not entail, for the undertaking responsible for carriage of the passengers, disproportionate consequences that can be equated with the consequences, as identified in the judgment in <span class="coj-italic">easyCar</span>, that are connected with exercise of a right of withdrawal in the context of a vehicle hire contract.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Where no transport ticket has been purchased at a reduced price, the consumer receives, in the event of withdrawal, the sum paid, corresponding to the price of the card, and loses the entitlement to a reduced price when purchasing passenger tickets subsequently. Furthermore, if a reduced price ticket has been purchased during the withdrawal period, it is apparent from the observations made during the oral part of the procedure before the Court that it would be possible to require the consumer to pay the difference between the price of the ticket corresponding to the reduced fare, resulting from use of the reduction card, and the price of that ticket corresponding to the full fare.</p>
