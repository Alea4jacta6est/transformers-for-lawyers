According to Kuršu zeme, even if it had acquired the goods at issue directly from Baltfisher, it would, under Article 10(7) of the Law on VAT, have been entitled to deduct the VAT on the acquisition of those goods inasmuch as that transaction was an ‘intra-Community acquisition’.</p>

In addition, it is not necessary for the first person acquiring the goods in question to have become the owner of those goods at the time of that transport, given that the existence of a supply within the meaning of that provision does not presuppose the transfer of the legal ownership of the goods (see, to that effect, order of 6 February 2014, Jagiełło, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A184&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑33/13</a>, not published, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A184&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2014:184</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A184&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point32" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">32</a> and the case-law cited).</p>

Consequently, it must be held that the sole existence of a chain of transactions and the fact that Kuršu zeme acquired material possession of the goods at issue in Baltfisher’s warehouse without actually receiving them from the company mentioned on the invoice as the supplier of those goods, namely KF Prema, is not, as the referring court also held, in itself grounds for concluding that Kuršu zeme did not acquire those goods from KF Prema and therefore that the transaction concluded between those two companies did not take place.</p>
