<h2> Searching better search options for lawyers </h2>
<i>DEMO with huggingface, jina and European Court of Justice judgments</i>
<br><br><br>

This site contains 113 judgments of European Court of Justice
from 2019 and 2020 concerning the tax issues.
<br><br>
All sentences from judgments have been encoded via BERT model
 (<code>bert-base-uncased</code>  provided by
 <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Huggingface's
 <code>transformers</code> library</a>), i.e. example
 of very powerful NLP model that conquered the AI applications.
<br><br>
The infrastructure of the search experience is base on
<a href="https://jina.ai/#/">JINA AI</a>
- a wonderful scalable library to design neural search engines,
basing on the <b>newest Deep Learning strategies</b>.
<br><br>
The entire concept - as well as the Jina and Huggingface
- has a great future in legal tech, because lawyers
needs to use a lots of documents, and searching among them is highly challenging...
<br><br><br>


<h2> ...That's why law is so compelling and hard</h2>
<br> <b> How it works? </b>
<ol>
<li>You need to write a phrase / sentence</li>
<li>Click Enter</li>
<li>You get the most similar sentence (the lower score, the better)</li>
</ol>

<br> <b> Enjoy!... </b><br>
<br>
... and be aware that this is a playground. Sometimes BERT gives not proper hits,
but sometimes analogies are pretty impressive, like
<br>
<br>
<b>QUERY:</b><i> that complaint was rejected</i>
<br>
<b>RESULTS:</b>
<ol>
<li><i>That request was rejected.</i></li>
<li><i>Its application was rejected,
as was the objection that it subsequently lodged.</i></li>
<li><i>That request was rejected.</i></li>
<li><i>That is unfair and unlawful.</i></li>
<li><i>That argument cannot be accepted.</i></li>

</ol>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
I am aiming to test other approaches (like other transformer architectures),
and fine-tune it, in order to prepare an ultimate benchmark of AI solutions
for legaltech, so stay tuned and follow me at
