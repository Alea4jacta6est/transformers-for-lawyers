<p class="normal">Doubts having been raised as to whether the transhipment scheme set up in Anguilla was in conformity with Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision, the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (United Kingdom) (‘HMRC’) conducted an investigation in November 1998, following which they drew up a report which found that the European undertakings acting as importers of aluminium into Anguilla were initially paying customs duties in Anguilla and obtaining an EXP certificate for those aluminium imports, and were subsequently being granted ‘transport aid’. According to the findings in that report, the ‘transport aid’ was paid to those undertakings by Corbis, which obtained a refund of the amounts paid by way of that aid from the Anguillan authorities. The report found that the transhipment scheme set up in Anguilla had, in essence, been established for the purposes of refunding customs duties, and concluded that the payment of such ‘transport aid’ had to be considered a partial refund of the customs duties paid in Anguilla, contrary to Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision.</p>

In point 4.2 of that report, OLAF noted that, throughout that period, the customs procedures in force in Anguilla had remained unchanged and that the undertakings that acted as importers of aluminium shipments into Anguilla were mentioned, in the EXP certificates issued by the Anguillan authorities, as exporters of those goods. According to the findings in point 4.2 of that report, the ‘transport aid’ paid to EU importers had also remained unchanged during that period, although Corbis had changed the content of the invoices addressed to the Anguillan authorities, which no longer mentioned the ‘transport aid’ paid by Corbis separately. Point 4.3 of the 2003 OLAF report added that the economic incentive paid in the form of such aid amounted, as a general rule, to 25 US dollars (USD) per tonne of aluminium imported into the European Union via Anguilla and could, in certain cases, exceed that amount. Also stated in point 4.3 were the names of the companies importing into the European Union which had received payments of that ‘transport aid’, as well as the total amount of those payments.</p>

<p class="normal">By Decision REC 03/2004 (C/2004/5358) of 28 December 2004 (‘Decision REC 03/2004’), the Commission found, with regard to the particular case of the import into Italy, by an Italian undertaking, of 41 unwrought non-alloy aluminium bars originating in third countries, on 1 April 1999 and covered by an EXP certificate issued by the Anguillan authorities, that post-clearance entry in the accounts of import duties was not necessary. In that decision, the Commission noted that, in the context of the investigation by the European Union and certain Member States of the transhipment scheme in Anguilla from 1998, it had been established that economic operators releasing aluminium for free circulation in Anguilla were eligible for the payment of ‘transport aid’ of USD 25 per tonne of aluminium, aid that was paid on the basis of an individual decision adopted by the Anguillan authorities. As regards the compatibility of EXP certificates issued in the context of the grant of such aid with Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision, the Commission stated the following, in paragraph 9 of Decision REC 03/2004:</p>
<p class="normal">‘After examining Anguilla’s application of Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision, the Commission concluded that there was a link between the payment of the customs duties and the subsequent transport aid, that the system established in the OCT (collection of customs duties followed by payment of transport aid) did not comply with Article 101(2) and that the transport aid should therefore be considered a partial refund of customs duties. The goods were not therefore eligible for duty-free import into the Community.’</p>

The Commission again considered that that scheme did not comply with Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision and that the authorities of that OCT knew or should reasonably have known that the conditions for issuing an EXP certificate were not fulfilled.

In the present case, the wrongful issue of EXP certificates by the Anguillan authorities prevented the recovery of customs duties and the transfer of those duties to the EU budget as own resources. By failing to compensate that loss of own resources, the United Kingdom hindered the proper functioning of the European Union’s system of own resources, since that loss would have to be compensated by all Member States via an increase in the own resource based on gross national income. Therefore, protection of the EU budget requires that the United Kingdom may be held liable for the infringement, by the Anguillan authorities, of the OCT Decision and for compensating the resulting loss of resources.</p>

In so far as the grant of such aid would have to be considered, according to Decisions REC 03/2004 and REM 03/2004, a partial refund of customs duties by Anguilla, those certificates were issued in breach of Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision. In the light of the information given in those certificates and the import declarations sent by the Italian authorities, the certificates had been used for the purposes of importing aluminium free of customs duties and, therefore, caused a loss of EU own resources, a loss which the United Kingdom had failed to compensate.</p>

It argues that, under national constitutional law, Anguilla is not part of the United Kingdom but forms a constitutional unit that is distinct from the United Kingdom, with a large degree of autonomy, including in respect of customs matters and the raising of revenue. Since Anguilla is governed in accordance with its own written constitution, the United Kingdom Parliament’s power to legislate in respect of Anguilla does not enable that parliament to intervene in the day-to-day activities of the authorities of that territory.</p>

In that regard, it notes that, from November 1998, the invoices sent by Corbis to the Anguillan authorities no longer mentioned any ‘transport aid’ but referred to ‘services rendered’ by that company. In addition, on 22 January 1999, the Anguilla House of Assembly adopted a resolution according to which any product transhipped through Anguilla to the European Union had to be subject to a rate of duty equivalent to that set out in the European Union’s tariff for that product. In any event, the United Kingdom submits that such ‘transport aid’ cannot be considered to be a partial refund of the customs duties that is incompatible with Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision.</p>

In its view, if the Italian authorities had adopted the safeguard measures recommended in the Communication on Mutual Assistance, the relevant operators might have declined to import the goods concerned into the European Union. Further, if the requirements relating to the conduct of those operators, as set out in paragraph 31 of Decision REC 03/2004, were not met, the Italian authorities should have sought recovery of the relevant customs duties, and therefore the United Kingdom cannot be held liable in that respect.</p>

However, paragraph 6 of that provision stated that the Commission ‘may participate’ in the enquiries to detect and prevent contraventions of the provisions governing the issue of EXP certificates, but did not impose an obligation on it in that respect. Moreover, although Article 7(7) of that annex provided that disputes arising on the occasion of such enquiries or raising a question of interpretation ‘shall be submitted’ to a dispute resolution procedure, it is apparent from the actual terms of that provision that it covered only disputes arising between the importing State and the exporting OCT and, therefore, was not binding on the Commission.</p>

In those decisions, the Commission found that the authorities of Anguilla and of Saint Pierre and Miquelon had granted payment, during the relevant periods, of ‘transport aid’ of USD 25 per tonne of aluminium to the economic operators who had first released aluminium for free circulation in those OCTs and then re-exported that aluminium to the European Union. The Commission found that, in those circumstances, the payment of that aid represented a link with the earlier payment of customs duties and constituted a partial refund of those duties, which meant that the EXP certificates issued by those authorities were contrary to the second indent of Article 101(2) of the OCT Decision. According to the findings in those decisions, the existence of ‘transport aid’ with those characteristics was identified as the decisive factor in concluding that there had been an infringement of that provision.</p>
