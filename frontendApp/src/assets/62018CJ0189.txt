First, they alone had access to the entire file relating to the criminal proceedings brought against the suppliers, to which Glencore was not a party and in which it could therefore not rely on any right, and evidence was thus gathered and used against it. Second, the tax authorities did not make available to Glencore either the file relating to the inspections carried out with respect to those suppliers, in particular the documents on which the tax authorities’ findings are based, or its report, or the administrative provisions which it adopted, but merely communicated a part of them, which it selected according to its own criteria.</p>
