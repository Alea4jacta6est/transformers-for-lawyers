Furthermore, it submits that companies established in Hungary may satisfy the obligations laid down by that law more easily than those established outside Hungary. Lastly, it maintains that fines imposed on companies established outside Hungary on the ground that they fail to comply with their obligations to submit a tax declaration differ from those applicable to companies established in Hungary which fail to comply with a similar obligation, and are disproportionate to the seriousness of the infringement committed, thereby constituting a restriction on the freedom to provide services in the European Union.</p>

<p class="normal">According to Google Ireland, taxpayers established abroad are also in a less favourable situation than companies established in Hungary as regards the exercise of the right to an effective remedy. Although they have the right to judicial review of a decision imposing a fine on them, which is, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 7/B and 7/D of the Law on the taxation of advertisements, final and enforceable merely by notification thereof, the rules governing the exercise of that right, however, restrict its scope. In particular, in the judicial review procedure under Article 7/B(4) of the Law on the taxation of advertisements, the court with jurisdiction can admit only documentary evidence and gives judgment without holding a hearing, whereas the objection procedure applicable to domestic taxpayers under the Law on general tax procedures is not subject to such limitations, since such taxpayers would have, inter alia, the right to bring an administrative law action. The provisions of the Law on the taxation of advertisements do not therefore afford the person fined the right to an effective remedy or a fair trial, as provided for in Article 47 of the Charter.</p>

<p class="normal">In that context, the referring court asks whether Articles 7/B and 7/D of the Law on the taxation of advertisements are compatible with Article 56 TFEU and the principle of non-discrimination. According to that court, the obligation to submit a tax declaration and the fines for failure to comply with that obligation — fines forming part of a very repressive and punitive system of penalties — are highly detrimental to companies established outside of Hungary and are in fact likely to restrict the freedom to provide services in the European Union. It considers in particular, as far as concerns the fines for failure to comply with the obligation to submit a tax declaration which were imposed on those companies, that the principle of proportionality was probably not observed in the present case. In that regard, it points, first, to the fact that a series of fines may be imposed on those taxpayers in five days during which the tax authority can triple the amount of the previous fine every day. Those penalties apply even before taxpayers are able to have notice of the daily tripling of the amount of the previous fine and before they can remedy the infringement, thus making it impossible for them to prevent the final fine from reaching the ceiling of HUF 1000000000 (EUR 3100000). In the referring court’s view, that fact can also give rise to the question of the compatibility of that administrative procedure with Article 41 of the Charter. Second, the referring court notes that the amount of the fine imposed under Article 7/D of the Law on the taxation of advertisements is, in total, up to 2000 times higher than that of the fine which may be imposed on a company established in Hungary which does not comply with the obligation to register for tax purposes laid down in Article 172 of the Law on general tax procedures.</p>

<p class="normal">Second, in so far as the legislation at issue provides for the automatic and daily adoption by the tax authority of decisions issuing fines such as those issued in the main proceedings, only a few days elapse between the adoption and notification of the initial decision to fine the taxpayer HUF 10000000 (approximately EUR 31000), on the one hand, and the notification of the last decision to issue a fine, on the other, as a result of which the total amount of the fines may reach the statutory ceiling of HUF 1000000000 (approximately EUR 3100000). Thus, even if that taxpayer acted with due diligence, it would, in any event, be in effect unable to comply with its obligation to submit a tax declaration in the Member State where the tax is levied prior to receiving the last decision in its Member State of establishment and could not therefore avoid significant increases in the amount of the previous fines. This also shows that the method of calculating fines laid down in the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not take account of the seriousness of the conduct of suppliers of advertising services who fail to comply with their obligation to submit a tax declaration.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed, as the Hungarian Government claimed in its written observations, under Article 7/B(5) of the Law on the taxation of advertisements, the tax authority may reduce the amount of the fines provided for in Article 7/B(2) and (3) of that law ‘without limit’ if the taxpayer complies with its obligation to submit a tax declaration when requested to do so by that authority for the first time.</p>

<p class="normal">However, it is clear from the very wording of that provision, subject to verification by the referring court, that the tax authority has at its disposal a mere discretion in that regard. A fine is no less disproportionate merely because the authorities of a Member State may, at their sole discretion, reduce its amount.</p>

<p class="normal">In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first, second, fourth and sixth questions is that Article 56 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State which fines suppliers of services established in another Member State for non-compliance with the obligation to submit a tax declaration for the purposes of their liability to a tax on advertising in a series of fines issued within several days, the amount of which, from the second day, is tripled in relation to the amount of the previous fine if it is still found that that obligation has not been complied with, leading to a total amount of several million euros, without the competent authority giving those suppliers of services the time necessary to comply with their obligations or the opportunity to submit their observations, or having itself examined the seriousness of the infringement, before adopting the final decision fixing the total amount of those fines, whereas the amount of the fine which suppliers of services established in the Member State where the tax is levied who fail to comply with a similar obligation to submit a tax declaration or to register contrary to the general provisions of national tax legislation is significantly less and is not increased, in the event of continued failure to comply with such an obligation, in the same proportions, nor necessarily within such a short period of time.</p>
