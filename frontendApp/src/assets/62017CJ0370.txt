That authority also stated that the workers concerned could have been eligible for social security benefits on the basis of those contributions and that, if their affiliation was cancelled, they might have found themselves without social protection. Last, in the view of that authority, the actual cancellation of the E 101 certificates at issue in the main proceedings was not justified, on the ground that they had been issued simply because the workers concerned were affiliated to the Spanish social security system.</p>

Those national courts considered that the workers concerned ought to have been affiliated, pursuant to the latter provision, to the French social security system, and not to the Spanish social security system. Those courts held, further, that that airline had been guilty of fraudulent manipulation intended to circumvent or evade the legal conditions governing the issue of those certificates.</p>
