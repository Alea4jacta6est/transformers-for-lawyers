<p class="normal">The referring court stresses the fact that the transactions involving the fictitious sale of electricity at issue in the main proceedings conferred no tax benefit on the companies carrying out those transactions, owing to the circular nature of the transactions, and that no financial loss was incurred by the Treasury. The referring court is unsure whether, in the present case, in regard to fictitious transactions, it is consistent with the principles of EU law to make the trader bear the VAT burden. The referring court takes the view that, if there is no tax fraud, the principle of the neutrality of VAT should prevail and that refusal to deduct VAT duly paid and the imposition of an additional fine equal to the amount of the improperly deducted VAT are not proportionate to the infringement consisting in the issuing of invoices for fictitious transactions.</p>

In this way, each trader was both the issuer of an invoice indicating VAT payable and the recipient of another invoice, relating to the purchase of the same amount of electricity at the same price and indicating the same amount of VAT. As the issuer of an invoice and in application of the rule set out in Article 203 of the VAT Directive, EN.SA. was thus liable to pay to the Treasury the amount of VAT indicated on that invoice. By contrast, in view of the fictitious nature of the transactions in question, that company was not permitted, in accordance with the requirement resulting from Article 168 of that directive, to deduct the tax in the same amount as that indicated on the invoice which it received relating to the re-purchase of the electricity.</p>
