<p class="normal">The right to correct the amount of the tax in the event of debts owed by debtors in insolvency proceedings was introduced into Law No 235/2004 on value added tax by Law No 47/2011 (‘the Law on VAT’), the recitals of which state:</p>
<p class="normal">‘This introduces a new possibility of correcting the amount of output tax in the case of debts owed by debtors (buyers) which are subject to insolvency proceedings, as a result of negative economic developments. The present proposal is an active response to the current economic situation and constitutes an anti-crisis measure to help companies whose cash-flow is reduced by irrecoverable debts owed by companies in insolvency.</p>
<p class="normal">Due to the impact of the global financial crisis, there are an increasing number of companies which are in insolvency proceedings and which are no longer able to meet their obligations towards their creditors (suppliers). Many suppliers (creditors) are no longer able to recover fully the debts owed to them by purchasers (debtors). This has a negative effect on the economic situation of previously “viable” companies.</p>
<p class="normal">On the basis of this provision, the creditor (supplier) will therefore have the right to correct the amount of the output tax if the purchaser (debtor) has not paid for the goods delivered or the service provided, and if the insolvency court has initiated insolvency proceedings against the purchaser. …</p>
<p class="normal">The proposal is fully compatible with Articles 90 and 185 of [Directive 2006/112]. Similar legislation is applicable in at least 12 EU Member States. That scheme is implemented, in different forms, in the following Member States: Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, France, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Greece, Latvia and the United Kingdom.’</p>

That provision embodies one of the fundamental principles of Directive 2006/112, according to which the taxable amount is the consideration actually received and the corollary of which is that the tax authorities may not collect an amount of VAT exceeding the tax which the taxable person received (see, inter alia, judgment of 6 December 2018, Tratave, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A989&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑672/17</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A989&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:989</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A989&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point29" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">29</a> and the case-law cited).</p>

<p class="normal">Likewise, although Article 273 of Directive 2006/112, also invoked by the Czech Republic in support of its interpretation, allows Member States to impose obligations which they deem necessary to ensure the correct collection of VAT and to prevent evasion, it follows from settled case-law of the Court that such measures may not, in principle, derogate from the rules relating to the taxable amount except within the limits strictly necessary for achieving that specific aim, since they must have as little effect as possible on the objectives and principles of Directive 2006/112 and may not therefore be used in such a way that they would have the effect of undermining the neutrality of VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 December 2018, Tratave, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A989&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑672/17</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A989&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:989</a>, paragraph <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A989&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point33" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">33</a> and the case-law cited), which constitutes a fundamental principle of the common system of VAT established by the relevant EU legislation.</p>

In addition, excluding any possibility of a reduction of the taxable amount in such circumstances and forcing that creditor taxable person to pay an amount of VAT which it did not receive in the course of its economic activities goes beyond, in any event, what is strictly necessary to achieve the objectives referred to in Article 273 of Directive 2006/112.</p>
