In the process, the competent authorities of the Member States will be at liberty to establish the fees and charges as flat-rate amounts based on the costs incurred and taking the specific situation of the establishments into account. Where fees are imposed on operators, common principles should apply. It is appropriate therefore to lay down the criteria for setting the level of inspection fees. With regard to fees applicable for import controls, it is appropriate to establish directly the rates for main import items with a view to ensuring their uniform application and to avoiding trade distortions.’</p>

<p class="normal">Nevertheless, the expression ‘staff involved in the official controls’ seems to leave sufficient discretion to include persons other than the official veterinarian and the official auxiliary, as long as they also contribute to the performance of official controls in slaughterhouses. Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that the EU legislature intended to make the system established by Regulation No 882/2004 stricter than the earlier system established by Directive 85/73 or that it intended to relax, by means of Regulation 2017/625, the allegedly stricter system under Regulation No 882/2004.</p>

<p class="normal">In the third place, the parties to the main proceedings do not agree on the interpretation of the rates applicable to contracted veterinarians. First, Gosschalk claims that the Minister has made a profit of almost EUR 8500000 because NWVA sometimes recruits official veterinarians through temporary employment agencies to carry out inspection work and pays them fees which are significantly lower than those charged to the slaughterhouses. Second, the contracted official auxiliaries from KDS or temporary employment agencies are paid only for the number of quarter-hour periods actually worked, even though the slaughterhouse is charged the quarter-hour periods requested but not worked. According to the Minister, that practice is intended to keep the rates the same for all parties, the surplus generated being used to cover NVWA’s overhead costs.</p>

<p class="normal">In the fourth place, Gosschalk complains that the rates applicable to contracted veterinarians enable KDS to build up buffer reserves to meet possible costs which may stem from a crisis. There is therefore no direct link between the inspection work actually performed and the buffer reserves and, accordingly, the costs applied for that purpose cannot be considered to be connected with staff actually responsible for carrying out inspection work. According to the Minister, this is to guarantee that, in the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as an epidemic which would suspend the slaughter of animals for a lengthy period, staff and training costs will continue to be paid without having to dismiss staff, even if KDS no longer receives any income. The existence of those buffer reserves thus makes it possible to resume inspections as soon as such a crisis has ended. It follows that the buffer reserves relate to amounts necessary to cover costs actually incurred. The amount of those buffer reserves deemed necessary corresponds to half of KDS’ average turnover achieved over the two years preceding the building up of those reserves, plus an amount of EUR 500000.</p>

In addition, it is not clear who, in the event of the liquidation or insolvency of KDS, is the beneficiary of the buffer reserves already built up.</p>

Those authorities should have a sufficient number of suitably qualified and experienced staff and possess adequate facilities and equipment to carry out their duties properly.

If such a crisis were to occur, the animals would have to be destroyed and slaughterhouses would cease to slaughter animals for human consumption. Thus, should veterinarians then be assigned to the destruction of animals, inspection assistants would no longer have any work and would not generate any income.
