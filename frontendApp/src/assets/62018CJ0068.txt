Secondly, clarification is required concerning the mechanism laid down in Article 2(3) of that directive, relating to the taxation of energy products for which that directive does not lay down any specific rate. In that regard, it is necessary to determine whether the refusal by the tax authority to take into consideration the subsequent decision to treat the semi-processed heating oil as heating oil infringes the principle of proportionality.</p>
