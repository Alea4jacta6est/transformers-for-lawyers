In order to be considered to be a taxable person, a person must carry out economic activities, that is to say activities for consideration. As the donations and endowments — which are essentially made for subjective reasons on charitable grounds and on a random basis — are not consideration for any economic activity, the raising and collection of them do not fall within the scope of the VAT Directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 March 1994, Tolsma, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1994%3A80&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑16/93</a>, <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1994%3A80&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=pdf&amp;target=CourtTab" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/pdf">EU:C:1994:80</a>, paragraphs <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1994%3A80&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point17" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">17</a> to <a class="CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1994%3A80&amp;lang=EN&amp;format=html&amp;target=CourtTab&amp;anchor=#point19" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xhtml+xml">19</a>).
