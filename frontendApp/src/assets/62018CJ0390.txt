Furthermore, it provides them with an optional tool for estimating the rental price having regard to the market averages taken from that platform. In addition, if a host accepts a guest, the guest will transfer to Airbnb Payments UK the rental price to which is added 6% to 12% of that amount in respect of charges and the service provided by Airbnb Ireland. Airbnb Payments UK holds the money on behalf of the guest and then, 24 hours after the guest checks in, sends the money to the host by transfer, thus giving the guest assurance that the property exists and the host a guarantee of payment. Finally, Airbnb Ireland has put in place a system whereby the host and the guest can leave an evaluation on a scale of zero to five stars, and that evaluation is available on the electronic platform at issue.</p>

<p class="normal">Bearing in mind that the French Republic did not give notification of the Hoguet Law and given the cumulative nature of the conditions laid down in Article 3(4) of Directive 2000/31, recalled in paragraphs 84 and 85 above, the view must be taken that that law cannot, on any view, be applied to an individual in a situation like that of Airbnb Ireland in the main proceedings, regardless of whether that law satisfies the other conditions laid down in that provision.</p>
