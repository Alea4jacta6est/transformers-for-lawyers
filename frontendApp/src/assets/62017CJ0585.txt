As the Advocate General states in point 53 of his Opinion, Article 58(1) of Regulation No 651/2014 does not impose any requirement that the conditions laid down in the other paragraphs of that article must be fulfilled in order for Article 58(1) to be applicable, since paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 58 each concern transitional rules for different situations.</p>

Further, although the referring court sets out in detail in its request for a preliminary ruling the reasons for its doubts regarding whether the aid scheme at issue in the disputes in the main proceedings may be considered to satisfy the condition laid down in that article, the referring court states expressly that it takes the view that both the conditions in Article 44(1), (2) and (4) of Regulation No 651/2014 and those resulting from various other provisions in Chapter I of that regulation are satisfied in the context of the disputes in the main proceedings.</p>

In particular, in accordance with that legislation, energy taxes must be refunded once per calendar year if they exceed, in total, 0.5% of the company’s net output value. In addition, that legislation limits the amount of the rebate by reference to the minimum taxation amounts provided for in Directive 2003/96. Additionally, the national administration has no discretion as to the amount of the tax reduction arising from that formula.</p>

Of these two methods of calculation, the one that determines the lowest amount of energy taxes to be refunded is applied.</p>

In the case of the first of those calculation methods, the applicable tax rate is effectively reduced to 0.5% of the beneficiary undertaking’s net output value, whereas, in the case of the second calculation method, the applicable tax rate is effectively reduced to the minimum level of taxation applicable to the energy source concerned.</p>
