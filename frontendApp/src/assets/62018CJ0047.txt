Article 41 of that regulation, in Chapter IV thereof, entitled ‘Provision of information for creditors and lodgement of their claims’, nonetheless lays down certain requirements relating to the content of the lodgement of a claim, which, as the Advocate General observed in points 59 and 72 of his Opinion, must be regarded as constituting maximum requirements, relating to the content of the lodgement of a claim, which may be imposed by national legislation on creditors who have their habitual residence, domicile or registered office in a Member State other than that in which the insolvency proceedings have been opened.</p>
