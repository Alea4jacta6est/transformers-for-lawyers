(2) if the generator generates more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste or one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste or one kilogram of extremely hazardous waste during any calendar month, the 90-day period begins on the first date on which any amount of hazardous waste begins to accumulate during that month.
(c) A generator who accumulates hazardous waste for more than 90 days is an operator of a storage facility and is subject to the requirements of chapters 14 and 15 of this division and the permit requirements of chapter 20 of this division, unless the generator has been granted an extension to the 90-day period or meets the requirements of subsection (d) or (e) of this section. An extension may be granted pursuant to section 66262.35 if non-RCRA or RCRA exempt hazardous wastes must remain on-site for longer than 90 days. An extension may be granted by the Department if RCRA hazardous wastes must remain onsite for longer than 90 days due to unforeseeable, temporary, and uncontrollable circumstances. An extension of up to 30 days for RCRA hazardous waste may be granted at the discretion of the Department on a case-by-case basis.
(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section and section 66262.35, a generator of less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste in any calendar month who accumulates hazardous waste onsite for 180 days or less, or 270 days or less if the generator transports the generator's own waste, or offers the generator's waste for transportation, over a distance of 200 miles or more, for offsite treatment, storage, or disposal, is not a storage facility if all of the following apply:
(1) The quantity of hazardous waste accumulated onsite never exceeds 6,000 kilograms.
(2) The generator complies with the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.34(d), (e) and (f).
(3) The generator does not hold acutely hazardous waste or extremely hazardous waste in an amount greater than one kilogram for more than 90 days.
(e)(1) A generator may accumulate as much as 55 gallons of hazardous waste, one quart of acutely hazardous waste (listed in section 66261.33(e)) or one quart of extremely hazardous waste at or near any point of generation, without a permit or grant of interim status, without complying with subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, if all of the following requirements are met with respect to this waste:
(A) the waste is accumulated in containers, other than tanks, at the initial accumulation point which is at or near the area where the waste is generated and which is under the control of the operator of the process generating the waste;
(B) the generator does not hold the waste onsite for more than one year from the initial date of accumulation, or for longer than the applicable accumulation period specified in subdivision (a) or (d), whichever occurs first. For purposes of this subdivision, the applicable accumulation period specified in subdivision (a) or (d) shall start on the date the quantity limitation specified in paragraph 1 of subsection (e) of this section is reached:
(C) the initial date of waste accumulation is clearly marked and visible for inspection on each container used for accumulation of hazardous waste;
(D) the generator complies with sections 66265.171, 66265.172, and 66265.173(a) of this division; and
(E) the generator complies with subsections (e)(2), (e)(3) and (f)(3) of this section.
(2) Except as provided in subsections (e)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(B) of this section, a process or group of processes meeting the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section, shall be subject to a single 55 gallon or one quart accumulation limit for that process or group of processes.
(A) If not all of the wastestreams generated by a single process or group of processes located within the same physical area are compatible, a separate 55 gallon or one quart limit shall apply to each group of wastestreams that are compatible.
(B) If the generator determines that using only one 55-gallon or one-quart container to initially accumulate specific compatible wastestreams is not practical (e.g., prevents recycling or requires unreasonable accumulation procedures) or safe from an environmental or worker/public health and safety standpoint, the generator may use a separate 55-gallon or one-quart container for those specific compatible wastestreams. The generator's determination shall be subject to review and approval by the Department at any time.
(3) A generator who has accumulated an amount of hazardous waste, acutely hazardous waste or extremely hazardous waste equal to any applicable quantity limitation listed in subsection (e)(1) of this section at or near any point of generation shall, with respect to that waste, comply within three days with subsection (a) of this section and other applicable provisions of this division. During the three day period the generator shall continue to comply with subsection (e)(1) of this section. Within the three day period, the generator shall mark the container holding the hazardous waste with the date the applicable quantity limitation was reached.
(f) Generators who accumulate hazardous waste on site without a permit or grant of interim status shall comply with the following requirements:
(1) the date upon which each period of accumulation begins shall be clearly marked and visible for inspection on each container and portable tank;
(2) the date the applicable accumulation period specified in subsection (a) or (d) of this section begins, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, shall be clearly marked and visible for inspection on each container and tank; and
(3) each container and tank used for onsite accumulation of hazardous waste shall be labeled or marked clearly with the words, “Hazardous Waste.” Additionally, all containers and portable tanks shall be labeled with the following information:
(A) composition and physical state of the wastes;
(B) statement or statements which call attention to the particular hazardous properties of the waste (e.g., flammable, reactive, etc.);
(C) name and address of the person producing the waste.
(g) This subsection takes effect on September 5, 2006. Except as provided in Health and Safety Code section 25160.6, subdivision (e), a generator who sends a shipment of hazardous waste to a designated facility with the understanding that the designated facility can accept and manage the waste and later receives that shipment back as a rejected load or residue in accordance with the manifest discrepancy provisions of sections 66264.72 or 66265.72 may accumulate the returned waste onsite for 90 days or less, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section. Upon receipt of the returned shipment, the generator shall:
(1) sign Item 18c of the manifest, if the transporter returned the shipment using the original manifest; or
(2) sign Item 20 of the manifest, if the transporter returned the shipment using a new manifest;
(3) submit a copy of the signed manifest to the department within 30 days of receipt. Mail the legible manifest copy, specifically the Designated Facility-to- Destination State manifest copy (Page 1 of the manifest as provided in section 66262.21, subsection (d)) to:

(a) A generator may accumulate non-RCRA or RCRA exempt hazardous waste for longer than the time periods specified in Section 66262.34(a) or (d) under the following conditions:
(1) if hazardous wastes must remain onsite for longer than the applicable time specified in section 66262.34(a) or (d) due to unforeseeable, temporary, and uncontrollable circumstances, a one-time extension of up to 90 days is automatically granted if all of the following conditions are met.
(A) The generator submits a letter, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) notifying the CUPA of the extension. If the generator is located in a jurisdiction with no CUPA, then the notification letter shall be submitted to the officer or agency authorized pursuant to subdivision (f) of Health and Safety Code Section 25404.3 to implement and enforce the requirements of Health and Safety Code Section 25404(c)(1). The letter shall be received by the CUPA or authorized officer or agency prior to the generator exceeding the applicable time specified in section 66262.34(a) or (d). In the letter the generator shall provide all of the following information:
1. A certification signed by the generator certifying that:
a. the eligibility requirements and the conditions for the extension are met; and
b. hazardous waste is not accumulated in waste piles; and
c. where hazardous waste is accumulated in tank systems, the generator complies with Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 10, sections 66265.190 through 66265.200, except 66265.197(c); and
d. where hazardous waste is accumulated in containers, the generator complies with Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 9, sections 66265.170 through 66265.177; and
e. where hazardous waste is accumulated on drip pads, the generator complies with Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 17.5 sections 66265.440 through 66265.445; and
f. where hazardous waste is accumulated in containment buildings, the generator complies with Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 29, sections 66265.1100 through 66265.1102; and
g. hazardous waste will be managed in accordance with all requirements of chapters 14 and 15 of this Division applicable to generators, except those specifically excluded elsewhere in this section.
2. Name, mailing address, and telephone number of the generator or the facility owner or operator.
3. Generator or the facility owner/operator name and address or legal description of the site location, and EPA ID number.
4. A detailed explanation of why the extension is needed. This shall include at a minimum: a description of the hazardous wastestream(s) for which the extension is being requested, the maximum quantity to be stored over the applicable time limits specified in Section 66262.34(a) or (d), an explanation of how the wastestream is generated, and the start and end dates of the 90 day extension period.
(B) All generators authorized by the Department with a permit, Standardized Permit, or grant of Interim Status shall simultaneously submit to the Department a copy of the letter submitted to the CUPA, or, if there is no CUPA, to the agency authorized pursuant to subdivision (f) of HSC Section 25404.3. The letter shall certify that the eligibility requirements and the conditions for the extension are met and that the hazardous waste will be managed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Title 22.
(C) Upon request by a CUPA, or the authorized officer or agency, the generator shall provide all documents, operating logs, reports, or any other information that supports the claim of necessity for the extension or relates to the management of the hazardous waste for which the extension is requested.
(2) One or more 90-day extension(s) may be granted at the discretion of the CUPA, or if no CUPA then at the discretion of the authorized officer or agency in that jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis if all of the following conditions are met:
(A) The generator submits a letter, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the CUPA, or if no CUPA then to the authorized officer or agency in that jurisdiction, requesting the extension. The letter shall be received by the CUPA or authorized officer or agency prior to the generator exceeding the accumulation time specified in Section 66262.34(a) or (d). In the letter the generator shall provide the information and certification listed in (a)(1)(A).
(B) The hazardous waste is not accumulated in waste piles.
(C) The generator meets one of the following circumstances:
1. There is a lack of offsite treatment capacity, offsite disposal capacity, or a treatment process for the generator's hazardous waste. The generator must submit documentation to the CUPA, or if no CUPA then to the authorized officer or agency in that jurisdiction, verifying attempts to locate an appropriate offsite treatment or disposal facility for the hazardous waste and list the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all the disposal and or treatment facilities that have been contacted.
2. Longer accumulation time is needed by the generator to treat its hazardous waste onsite. The speculative accumulation of hazardous waste is not sufficient reason for an extension.
3. An extension is needed because the onsite cleanup activity requires longer accumulation time (e.g., delays in clean up due to weather conditions).
4. An extension is needed because there was an emergency (e.g., mechanical failure, fire, etc.) at the business.
5. Generators that have already qualified for one 90-day extension beyond the applicable time specified in Section 66262.34(a) or (d) under section (a)(1)(A) above, but still require more time due to unforeseeable, temporary, and uncontrollable circumstances.
6. Other good cause as determined by the CUPA, or if no CUPA then by the authorized officer or agency in that jurisdiction.
(D) Upon request by a CUPA, or if no CUPA then by the authorized officer or agency in that jurisdiction, the generator shall provide all documents, operating logs, reports, or any other information that supports the claim of necessity for the extension or relates to the management of the hazardous waste for which the extension is requested.
(3) In the event of a disaster, the Department may grant an emergency waiver allowing a 90-day extension to the generators within the geographic location of the disaster if the following conditions are met:
(A) The hazardous waste must be accumulated in tank systems that comply with the technical standards of Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 10, or containers that comply with the technical standards of Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 9, or placed on drip pads and the generator complies with Title 22, CCR, chapter 15, article 17.5, or placed in containment buildings and the generator complies with article 29 of chapter 15 of Title 22, CCR. Hazardous waste accumulated in waste piles shall not be eligible for this extension.
(B) The emergency waiver shall only be activated when there has been a proclamation of a state of emergency by the federal, state, or local government for the geographic location (e.g., city or county).
(C) The Department shall issue a press release specifying which particular geographic location (e.g., city, county) will be granted an emergency waiver.
(D) The Department may further extend the effective period of the emergency waiver, as necessary, to assist the recovery process from the disaster. This extension shall also be announced through a press release.
(E) Upon request by the Department, a CUPA, or if no CUPA then by the authorized officer or agency in that jurisdiction, the generator shall provide all documents, operating logs, reports, or any other information that supports the claim of necessity for the extension or relates to the management of the hazardous waste for which the extension is requested.

(a) Scope. The level of control for exports and imports of waste is indicated by assignment of the waste to either a list of wastes subject to the Green control procedures or a list of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures and whether the waste is or is not hazardous waste. The OECD Green and Amber lists are incorporated by reference in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 260.11.
(1) Green list wastes.
(A) Green wastes that are not hazardous wastes are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions, and are not subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82.
(B) Green wastes that are hazardous wastes are subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82.
(2) Amber list wastes.
(A) Amber wastes that are hazardous wastes are subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82, even if they are imported to or exported from a country that does not consider the waste to be hazardous or control the transboundary shipment as a hazardous waste import or export.
(1) For exports, the exporter shall comply with 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.83.
(2) For imports, the recovery or disposal facility and the importer shall comply with 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.84.
(B) Amber wastes that are not hazardous wastes, but are considered hazardous by the other country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the country that considers the waste hazardous, and are not subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82. All responsibilities of the importer or exporter shift to the foreign importer or foreign exporter in the other country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts.
(C) Some Amber list wastes are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82.
(3) Mixtures of wastes.
(A) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not hazardous waste is not subject to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82.

(A) A copy of each notification of intent to export and each U.S. EPA AOC for a period of at least three (3) years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter;
(B) A copy of each annual report for a period of at least three (3) years from the due date of the report;
(C) A copy of any exception reports and a copy of each confirmation of receipt (i.e., movement document) sent by the foreign receiving facility to the exporter for at least three (3) years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter; and
(D) A copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal sent by the foreign receiving facility to the exporter for at least three (3) years from the date that the foreign receiving facility completed interim or final processing of the hazardous waste shipment.
(E) A copy of each contract or equivalent arrangement established per 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.85 for at least three (3) years from the expiration date of the contract or equivalent arrangement.
(2) Exporters may satisfy these recordkeeping requirements by retaining electronically submitted documents in the exporter's account on U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any U.S. EPA or authorized state inspector. No exporter may be held liable for the inability to produce such documents for inspection under this section if the exporter can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system for which the exporter bears no responsibility.
(3) The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the U.S. EPA Administrator.

(3) The importer shall comply with the contract requirements in subsection (f) of this section.
(4) The importer shall ensure compliance with the movement documents requirements in subsection(d) of this section; and
(5) The importer shall ensure compliance with the manifest instructions for import shipments in subsection (c) of this section.
(b) Notifications. In cases where the competent authority of the country of export does not regulate the waste as hazardous waste and, thus, does not require the foreign exporter to submit to it a notification proposing export and obtain consent from U.S. EPA and the competent authorities for the countries of transit, but U.S. EPA does regulate the waste as hazardous waste:
(1) The importer is required to provide notification in English to U.S. EPA of the proposed transboundary movement of hazardous waste at least sixty (60) days before the first shipment is expected to depart the country of export (the United States does not currently require financial assurance for these waste shipments). Notifications submitted prior to the electronic import-export reporting compliance date shall be mailed or hand delivered to U.S. EPA at the addresses specified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.82(e). Notifications submitted on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date shall be submitted electronically using U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. The notification may cover up to one year of shipments of one or more hazardous wastes being sent from the same foreign exporter, and shall include all of the following information:
(A) Foreign exporter name, address, telephone, fax numbers, and email address;

Date:
(2) Notifications listing interim recycling operations or interim disposal operations. If the receiving facility listed in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section shall engage in any of the interim recovery operations R12 or R13 or interim disposal operations D13 through D15, the notification submitted according to subsection (b)(1) of this section shall also include the final recovery or disposal facility name, address, telephone, fax numbers, email address, technologies employed, and which of the applicable recovery or disposal operations R1 through R11 and D1 through D12, shall be employed at the final recovery or disposal facility. The recovery and disposal operations in this subsection are defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.81.
(3) Renotifications. When the foreign exporter wishes to change any of the conditions specified on the original notification (including increasing the estimate of the total quantity of hazardous waste specified in the original notification or adding transporters), the importer shall submit a renotification of the changes to U.S. EPA using the allowable methods in subsection (b)(1) of this section. Any shipment using the requested changes cannot take place until U.S. EPA and the countries of transit consent to the changes and the importer receives a U.S. EPA AOC letter documenting the consents to the changes.
(4) A notification is complete when U.S. EPA determines the notification satisfies the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(A) through (M) of this section. Where a claim of confidentiality is asserted with respect to any notification information required by subsection (b)(1)(A) through (M) of this section, U.S. EPA may find the notification not complete until any such claim is resolved in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 260.2.
(5) Where U.S. EPA and the countries of transit consent to the proposed transboundary movement(s) of the hazardous waste(s), U.S. EPA shall forward a U.S. EPA AOC letter to the importer documenting the countries' consents and U.S. EPA's consent. Where any of the countries of transit or U.S. EPA objects to the proposed transboundary movement(s) of the hazardous waste or withdraws a prior consent, U.S. EPA shall notify the importer.
(6) Export of hazardous wastes originally imported into the United States. Export of hazardous wastes that were originally imported into the United States for recycling or disposal operations is prohibited unless an exporter in the United States complies with the export requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.83(b)(7).
(c) RCRA Manifest instructions for import shipments.
(1) When importing hazardous waste, the importer shall meet all the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.20 for the manifest except that:
(A) In place of the generator's name, address and U.S. EPA identification number, the name and address of the foreign generator and the importer's name, address and U.S. EPA identification number shall be used.
(B) In place of the generator's signature on the certification statement, the importer or his agent shall sign and date the certification and obtain the signature of the initial transporter.
(2) The importer may obtain the manifest form from any source that is registered with the U.S. EPA as a supplier of manifests (e.g., states, waste handlers, and/or commercial forms printers).
(3) In the International Shipments block, the importer shall check the import box and enter the point of entry (city and State) into the United States.
(4) The importer shall provide the transporter with an additional copy of the manifest to be submitted by the receiving facility to U.S. EPA in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations sections 264.71(a)(3) and 265.71(a)(3).
(5) In lieu of the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.20(d), where a shipment cannot be delivered for any reason to the receiving facility, the importer shall instruct the transporter in writing via fax, email or mail to:
(A) Return the hazardous waste to the foreign exporter or designate another facility within the United States; and
(B) Revise the manifest in accordance with the importer's instructions.
(d) Movement document requirements for import shipments.
(1) The importer shall ensure that a movement document meeting the conditions of subsection (d)(2) of this section accompanies each transboundary movement of hazardous wastes from the initiation of the shipment in the country of export until it reaches the receiving facility, including cases in which the hazardous waste is stored and/or sorted by the importer prior to shipment to the receiving facility, except as provided in subsections (d)(1)(A) and (B).
(A) For shipments of hazardous waste within the United States by water (bulk shipments only), the importer shall forward the movement document to the last water (bulk shipment) transporter to handle the hazardous waste in the United States if imported by water.
(B) For rail shipments of hazardous waste within the United States which start from the company originating the export shipment, the importer shall forward the movement document to the next non-rail transporter, if any, or the last rail transporter to handle the hazardous waste in the United States if imported by rail.
(2) The movement document shall include the following subsection (d)(2)(A) through (O) of this section:
(A) The corresponding AOC number(s) and waste number(s) for the listed waste;
(B) The shipment number and the total number of shipments under the AOC number;
(C) Foreign exporter name, address, telephone, fax numbers, and email address;

(M) Appropriate signatures for each custody transfer (e.g., transporter, importer, and owner or operator of the receiving facility);
(N) Each person that has physical custody of the waste from the time the movement commences until it arrives at the receiving facility shall sign the movement document (e.g., transporter, importer, and owner or operator of the receiving facility); and
(O) The receiving facility shall send a copy of the signed movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery to the foreign exporter, to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit, and for shipments received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to U.S. EPA electronically using U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system.
(e) Duty to return or export hazardous wastes. When a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes cannot be completed in accordance with the terms of the contract or the consent(s), the provisions of subsection (f)(4) of this section apply. If alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover the hazardous waste in an environmentally sound manner in the United States, the hazardous waste shall be returned to the country of export or exported to a third country. The provisions of subsection (b)(6) of this section apply to any hazardous waste shipments to be exported to a third country. If the return shipment shall cross any transit country, the return shipment may only occur after U.S. EPA provides notification to and obtains consent from the competent authority of the country of transit, and provides a copy of that consent to the importer.
(f) Import contract requirements.
(1) Imports of hazardous waste shall occur under the terms of a valid written contract, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Such contracts or equivalent arrangements shall be executed by the foreign exporter, importer, and the owner or operator of the receiving facility, and shall specify responsibilities for each. Contracts or equivalent arrangements are valid for the purposes of this section only if persons assuming obligations under the contracts or equivalent arrangements have appropriate legal status to conduct the operations specified in the contract or equivalent arrangements.
(2) Contracts or equivalent arrangements shall specify the name and U.S. EPA ID number, where available, of subsection (f)(2)(A) through (D) of this section:
(A) The foreign company from where each import shipment of hazardous waste is initiated;
(B) Each person who shall have physical custody of the hazardous wastes;
(C) Each person who shall have legal control of the hazardous wastes; and
(D) The receiving facility.
(3) Contracts or equivalent arrangements shall specify the use of a movement document in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.
(4) Contracts or equivalent arrangements shall specify which party to the contract shall assume responsibility for alternate management of the hazardous wastes if their disposition cannot be carried out as described in the notification of intent to export submitted by either the foreign exporter or the importer. In such cases, contracts shall specify that:
(A) The transporter or receiving facility having actual possession or physical control over the hazardous wastes shall immediately inform the foreign exporter and importer, and the competent authority where the shipment is located of the need to arrange alternate management or return; and
(B) The person specified in the contract shall assume responsibility for the adequate management of the hazardous wastes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, if necessary, arranging the return of the hazardous wastes and, as the case may be, shall provide the notification for re-export required in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.83(b)(7).
(5) Contracts shall specify that the importer or the receiving facility that performed interim recycling operations R12, R13, or RC16, or interim disposal operations D13 through D15 or DC15 through DC17, as appropriate, shall provide the notification required in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.83(b)(7) prior to the re-export of hazardous wastes. The recovery and disposal operations in this subsection are defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.81.
(6) Contracts or equivalent arrangements shall include provisions for financial guarantees, if required by the competent authorities of any countries concerned, in accordance with applicable national or international law requirements.
(A) Financial guarantees so required are intended to provide for alternate recycling, disposal or other means of sound management of the wastes in cases where arrangements for the shipment and the recovery operations cannot be carried out as foreseen. The United States does not require such financial guarantees at this time; however, some OECD Member countries or other foreign countries do. It is the responsibility of the importer to ascertain and comply with such requirements; in some cases, persons or facilities located in those countries may refuse to enter into the necessary contracts absent specific references or certifications to financial guarantees.
(7) Contracts or equivalent arrangements shall contain provisions requiring each contracting party to comply with all applicable requirements of this article.
(8) Upon request by U.S. EPA, importers or disposal or recovery facilities shall submit to U.S. EPA copies of contracts, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Information contained in the contracts or equivalent arrangements for which a claim of confidentiality is asserted in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 2.203(b) shall be treated as confidential and shall be disclosed by U.S. EPA only as provided in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 260.2.
(g) Confirmation of recovery or disposal. The receiving facility shall do the following:
(1) Send copies of the signed and dated confirmation of recovery or disposal, as soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after completing recovery or disposal on the waste in the shipment and no later than one (1) calendar year following receipt of the waste, to the foreign exporter, to the competent authority of the country of export, and for shipments recycled or disposed of on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to U.S. EPA electronically using U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system.
(2) If the receiving facility performed any of recovery operations R12, R13, or RC16, or disposal operations D13 through D15, or DC17, the receiving facility shall promptly send copies of the confirmation of recovery or disposal that it receives from the final recovery or disposal facility within one (1) year of shipment delivery to the final recovery or disposal facility that performed one of recovery operations R1 through R11, or RC14 to RC15, or one of disposal operations D1 through D12, or DC15 to DC16, to the competent authority of the country of export, and for confirmations received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to U.S. EPA electronically using U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. The recovery and disposal operations in this subsection are defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.81.
(h) Recordkeeping.
(1) The importer shall keep the following records and provide them to U.S. EPA or authorized state personnel upon request:
(A) A copy of each notification that the importer sends to U.S. EPA under subsection (b)(1) of this section and each U.S. EPA AOC it receives in response for a period of at least three (3) years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial foreign transporter; and
(B) A copy of each contract or equivalent arrangement established per subsection (f) of this section for at least three (3) years from the expiration date of the contract or equivalent arrangement.
(2) The receiving facility shall keep the following records:
(A) A copy of each confirmation of receipt (i.e., movement document) that the receiving facility sends to the foreign exporter for at least three (3) years from the date it received the hazardous waste;
(B) A copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal that the receiving facility sends to the foreign exporter for at least three (3) years from the date that it completed processing the waste shipment;
(C) For the receiving facility that performed any of recovery operations R12, R13, or RC16, or disposal operations D13 through D15, or DC17 (recovery and disposal operations defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 262.81), a copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal that the final recovery or disposal facility sent to it for at least three (3) years from the date that the final recovery or disposal facility completed processing the waste shipment; and
(D) A copy of each contract or equivalent arrangement established per subsection (f) of this section for at least three (3) years from the expiration date of the contract or equivalent arrangement.
(3) Importers and receiving facilities may satisfy these recordkeeping requirements by retaining electronically submitted documents in the importer's or receiving facility's account on U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any U.S. EPA or authorized state inspector. No importer or receiving facility may be held liable for the inability to produce such documents for inspection under this article if the importer or receiving facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with U.S. EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system for which the importer or receiving facility bears no responsibility.
(4) The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the U.S. EPA Administrator.
